        <![CDATA[<p>Oh yeaaaaah. The super nebulous money $ talk for freelance artists. You know, the one where you just want someone to tell you what you should charge, but it is way more complicated than that? Hopefully this one is at least somewhat helpful in helping someone out there figure out what is right for them. Check it out and let me know if you find it helpful, or if you think I missed something? </p><div class="media-asset-container media-asset fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable"><iframe data-asset-id="563202" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_TMDEy7gP0?feature=oembed&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><br></p>]]>

Alex is recouping some costs, and is also trying to get through this time of lock down, and he will be getting 100% of the revenue from this sale. I am just hosting it here to help him out and because I have a bit larger reach on ArtStation. We both, along with Gabby, thank you for the support and hope you get something out the class! </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>You have a gift you can give the world, but only if you take care of yourself!!</p><p>Changed the planned video this week to talk about surviving the world as artists (And I don't say the "C" word!!!). There is a constant barrage of input in the world we live in, and most of it is negative. So I decided to chat about how we can protect our own creativity and sanity, and how we have the power to make the world better. Hopefully, if you watch the video, and watch me doodle with markers, it will give you a break, and you can go pay it forward. Keep your chins up and your pens, brushes and stylus' moving. We need your creations in the world to give us that oasis of imagination! </p><p><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-asset fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable"><iframe data-asset-id="550615" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r239pZFibqM?feature=oembed&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Here is my little, super not important, marker doodle. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/550/616/large/20200316_220114.jpg?1584465423" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="550616" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/550/616/medium/20200316_220114.jpg?1584465423" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br>  </p>]]>

      <title>World-Building Part 1: Planning and Designing by Randall Mackey</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Follow me and this project on instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/moonjellyworkshop/" target="_blank">MoonJelly Workshop</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cptcrandall/" target="_blank">Randall Mackey</a></p><p>A couple of years ago, I got cheeky on May 1st during #mermay, right after watching a doc on the innate savagery of Orca's and I decided to draw an anthropomorphic Orca character who hunted mermaids. With that the Orkaan were born, and I spent a couple of weeks designing more of them and a their culture. Then, I moved on, and let them sit. Last year, when my close friend Allison Fox and I decided to write and illustrate a story together, the Orkaan found a new home! We have since outlined our story, and are in the early phases of writing and world-building our universe. But we are also on a tight self imposed deadline to have the book finished and illustrated by the end of 2020. I want to talk about the thought process and approach we are taking, and talk a bit about the balance between over-designing, and executing too early without a plan! At the end of this blog will also be a gallery of some of our rough sketches. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/761/large/AlleyOfBones_01.jpg?1581293636" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534761" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/761/medium/AlleyOfBones_01.jpg?1581293636" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>For those of you who have seen my ArtStation Learning class, you know about my <a href="https://www.artstation.com/learning/courses/qP/art-v-design" target="_blank">Design Pyramid</a>. The Cliff Notes version is that you start at the bottom and climb the pyramid, from dozens of super rough sketches, through refining on up to the top of the pyramid where you end up with a couple of final concepts or illustrations. Currently, we are at the bottom of the pyramid.<br><br>With our outline roughed in through the end of the story, and Allison furiously free-writing the first rough draft based on the outline, I have a prompt list of locations, characters and creatures for our world to work off of. It is imperative that I mostly stick to this. It is also imperative that I am super time efficient, as I could fall into a trap of worrying about how pretty the art is, and end up spending too long in the design phase. If I spend 4 hours doing one nice pencil sketch, then I missed the boat on doing 20 really rough and crappy ones, and I will not get enough designs and material to Allison in time. The purpose of art at this phase is to design, not to make beautiful, finished, portfolio worthy illustrations. And because getting to those illustrations are the end goal, I need to time budget properly to leave myself the time to work on those later. It is also important to work fast and loose, because the designs are informing Allison as she describes the world through text, and the sketches I produce are a large part of that. We are striving to work similar to what Lucasfilm talks about doing a lot with the Star Wars films, where you create a loop where art informs story, which in turn informs art. This process is a blast to be a part of, as the inspiration become exponential. I sketch a design, Allison writes from it, adding her takes and twists, coming up with new things, which then triggers me to come up with more crazy designs.<br><br>This loop can become dangerous in and of itself, as you can endlessly keep evolving one location or moment, and not keep moving forward. Also, if I spend too much time on the sketches, trying to make them things that I am more proud of, then I would be going too slow to get Allison the designs she needs. So the focus at this phase is communicating internally, to Allison and to myself, at the simplest, almost barely passable level.<br><br>This is hard to do as an artist, as we want to flex a bit more, execute to a high level, and have each piece we do be something that we are proud to show off. But you have to remind yourself daily what the purpose is. And remember that the polished, rendered, nice pretty illustrations are coming! Also, this is a good way to avoid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2056pPqISQo" target="_blank">The World-Building Trap</a> Jake Parker just talked about in his latest YouTube video. The place where you are endless designing and showing off bits and pieces of a world, but never actually conjuring it into existence. At the same token, you can also fall into a trap of under-designing and setting out to create a finished thing without enough guidance. Also a very dangerous place to be.<br><br>So for us, we have deadlines imposed of when we need each phase completed, and when we will begin to transition from the rough draft/world-building phase and work on our first polish draft and start illustrating.<br><br>If you are setting out to build and design a world, I suggest starting at this phase. Rough, loose, quick. Barely enough to communicate where you are going. Take notes on these sketches. Fill out pages. Treat nothing as precious. Carry a pocket sketchbook everywhere, and even if you are standing and drawing for 90 seconds, get any ideas you have out onto the paper. Even if it is not representational, your mind will remember what you were thinking at the moment. And if you are working with someone else, this will be enough to communicate with them, and for them to recall and reference.</p><p>Right now, I am all about using Moleskine Flow on iPad. It is a layer-less sketching software from the makers of the actual physical sketchbooks. No real painting, Just some pen and marker tools, and an infinite Left to Right canvas (safety note, from experience, export at the end of each session, just in case!). I also always have a sketchbook in my back pocket and a ball point pen. I also have a slightly larger, but still small real Moleskine that I have tons of story notes and 20 second sketches in. Keep it simple. Focus on WHAT you are designing, and what it should be like, and not HOW you are are drawing. That will come later! And when you get to that point, you will have a much stronger starting off point to work from!<br><br>In the next blog, I will talk about Sharing and Secrets. And some arguments and Pro/Cons of how much to share and how much to keep your own NDA. In the meantime, here are some of the exploratory sketches I have done on the iPad in Flow, usually in the car, in bed, or on the couch watching a show. </p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/769/large/File_001_(2).jpg?1581296208" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534769" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/769/medium/File_001_(2).jpg?1581296208" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/770/large/File_001_(3).jpg?1581296209" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534770" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/770/medium/File_001_(3).jpg?1581296209" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/779/large/Tundara_Dwellings.jpg?1581296388" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534779" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/779/medium/Tundara_Dwellings.jpg?1581296388" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/772/large/OB_WorldBuilding_Sketches_03_(1).jpg?1581296211" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534772" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/772/medium/OB_WorldBuilding_Sketches_03_(1).jpg?1581296211" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/774/large/OB_WorldBuilding_Sketches_04_(1).jpg?1581296212" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534774" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/774/medium/OB_WorldBuilding_Sketches_04_(1).jpg?1581296212" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/768/large/OB_WorldBuilding_Sketches_05_(1).jpg?1581296208" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534768" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/768/medium/OB_WorldBuilding_Sketches_05_(1).jpg?1581296208" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/771/large/OB_WorldBuilding_Sketches_07_(1).jpg?1581296209" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534771" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/771/medium/OB_WorldBuilding_Sketches_07_(1).jpg?1581296209" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/773/large/Orkaan_Alley_of_Bones.jpg?1581296211" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="534773" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/534/773/medium/Orkaan_Alley_of_Bones.jpg?1581296211" class="img-responsive" /></a>  </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image"><br></div><p><br></p>]]>

      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>I was talking with an artist yesterday, and we got talking about the lack of control that happens during the creation process. Like, when you sit down to paint, or sculpt, or write, or build, or cook...the creation actually has a higher percentage of control than you do. You set out with what feels like a fairly concrete idea in your head of what you will be making, but in actuality it is super abstract. And as you go through the process of creating it, it gets to decide way more of what the end result will be than you give it credit for. Your creations have their own will.</p><p>You sit down to paint, you have a clear scene in your head, and know exactly what you will do. But as you work, the fundamental rules you know, your stylistic tendencies, and the results on the canvas start to steer you in slightly divergent directions. Small enough that you brush them off, or know that they are the right choice, in the moment. Then, when your painting is finished, you might have something that is actually really good, but in small increments it has moved away greatly from your original vision (much like being 1 degree off on a compass is NBD over 100 yards, but massive after 3 miles). And even though it is good, solid, and a great piece of art you feel like you lost control. (Sidebar: this is why James Gurney builds maquettes for his scenes and also why reference is so important).</p><p>I wonder if this is the root of most (if not all) Imposter Syndrome. Even the "top" pros that everyone admires have it. Maybe this is why we all do to some extent. I think we look at other artists, see their end results, and think "They must have planned it and executed it exactly the way it ended up". But I don't think this is true. I think there is a "listening" process that happens during creation. The scene changes, the concept evolves, the character "tells" you what it is like, etc. But subconsciously we don't like not being in control, and we equate control with ability level, and because we feel a lack of total control we feel like we suck.</p><p>When it comes to fundamentals, some of this should be heeded. And no one gets gud by not striving to be better and having that drive. But, I think when you enter the creative process, start designing, and putting your hands to your work, there is some "listening" that need to happen. Train hard in your fundamentals, and rely on them, bring them as your half of the offering. Set out with a plan. But let the work speak to you. And when it does, and you inevitably listen, don't feel like you lost control. Feel like a Jedi.</p><p>George was right all along. The Force is real. You can't "control" the Force, but you can channel it. It exists in the space between your mind and whatever it is you are creating. Jedi have to train. But they also learn to let go.</p><p>Let the Force surround you, penetrate you, and bind your creations together.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/532/384/large/obiwan.jpg?1580494730" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="532384" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/532/384/medium/obiwan.jpg?1580494730" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br>  </p>]]>

      <title>SMITE-Icons, Abilities, Frame Assets by Randall Mackey</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This is just a tiny fraction of the work I have done for Smite over the past 4-5 years. Item icons, selection icons, God Abilities, hand-painted frame assets. It was crazy to see how much I have done when I was going through it all. I don't know if I have painted the most game icons of any single person in the industry, but I think I would certainly be in the running. </p>]]>

      <title>The Lonely Cosmonaut-Render Test by Randall Mackey</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This is a super quick ( &lt;3 hours) and simple sketch I did to try and put together the techniques I want to stick to when illustrating The Lonely Cosmonaut throughout 2019. This is not quite on target for what I want the level to be, but it proves out the theories in my head and also informed me about what to push further and what to adjust going forward. </p>]]>

      <title>Star Wars: The Rebel Files. by Randall Mackey</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Some of the ships I had the opportunity to illustrate for The Rebel Files book. All of these obviously existed within the lore of Star Wars already. 
<br />However, the bottom three existed in only 1 or two available illustrations in RPG guide books, and 2 of them existed only as a single side view blueprint, so I had the task of translating that  into 3D space and rendering it out. Honestly I had the most fun doing the Star Wars: Rebels versions of the B-Wing and A-Wing, because of their homage to Ralph. </p>

      <title>The Lonely Cosmonaut: Ice Planet Design by Randall Mackey</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Eyva will travel to a few planets on her quest to figure out where she is, repair her ship and evade the American's on her tail. I really decided early on I wanted to go a little bonkers on the planet designs. So this planet vents steam and then accumulates it again as it travels back around, constantly shedding matter and replenishing it, in a ring that orbits the system's star. </p>

<p>The surface of the world is covered in ice, but towards the surface it is super warm, creating a tropical zone deep in the frozen canyons. (inspired by things like sulfur hot springs). Other expeditions were sent out to colonize the cosmos in the centuries since Eyva left Earth, and many of them were failed and their ruins will litter these worlds and provide set pieces for Eyva's adventures. </p>]]>

      <title>The Lonely Cosmonaut: Cosmodrome by Randall Mackey</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Secret Cosmodrome located in the Romanian Carpathian mountains. This is where the mission to scout the secret world launches from. Suspecting that the CIA is getting hot on the trail, the Soviet government orders all records of the world purged, fearing the US could get a launch off first and claim the world for themselves. The only remaining information is stored aboard the craft and at the hidden cosmodrome site. When their own KGB intel suspects that the US is aware of the site, the Soviets move the timeline up and decided to launch immediately, fearing an imminent nuclear strike. </p>

      <title>ILM Challenge: The Ride 2 by Randall Mackey</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This was the second design for The Ride phase. The only vehicles we see on Bespin are the Cloud Cars. How would Lando be able to show people around the city and Tibana Gas mining works and pull his hustle? I figured he would have a slightly outdated limo that would give a faux sense of exuberant luxury.
<br />The sketch was created traditionally with marker and pen on paper, then scanned and tweaked in PS. 
<br />This was chosen as an ILM Favorite</p>]]>
