        <![CDATA[<p><em>03/08/20 - <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson" target="_blank"><em>Kieran Goodson</em></a>  - 15 min read</em>   </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/367/large/part_III_an.jpg?1594944408" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631367" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/367/medium/part_III_an.jpg?1594944408" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h3><strong>Guide to Game Art Applications</strong></h3><p>I recently celebrated my first anniversary in games and I've been reminiscing about my pre-industry days. I remember the struggles of casting out job applications and the rush of getting bites back from studios. It was difficult to get any form of feedback after applying and responses were hard to come by. Being ghosted by studios was the worst feeling in the world. It took me 11 months of applications and portfolio building to get a job.</p><blockquote><p>So I can still empathise a lot when students and grads message me week upon week asking for CV, portfolio and job application advice. </p></blockquote><p>Due to this, I'm always giving out the same feedback over and over again so today I’m presenting a guide for anyone preparing job applications within the games industry, particularly for those at entry-level.</p><p>If you missed the last two parts on <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson/blog/mY0N/guide-to-game-art-applications-portfolios-and-job-postings" target="_blank">portfolios and job postings</a> as well as <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson/blog/nz0A/guide-to-game-art-applications-cvs-and-covering-letters" target="_blank">CV's and Covering Letters</a>, then make sure to head back and check them out. Today we're covering the final stages of the application process. Art tests, interviews and other advice. Without further ado...</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/571/large/part_III_header.jpg?1595015792" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631571" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/571/medium/part_III_header.jpg?1595015792" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h3><strong>Art Tests</strong></h3><p>Art tests are an area that is crucial to be familiar with. Unfortunately, as I have never taken part in one, I cannot personally add anything to this part of the guide. Fortunately, my good friend <a href="https://www.artstation.com/jonjo">Jonjo Hemmens</a> already covered this topic extensively in his VERY comprehensive article on <a href="https://80.lv/articles/game-art-tests-and-how-to-approach-them/">game art tests and how to approach them</a>. I highly recommend it after finishing this post.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" href="https://80.lv/articles/game-art-tests-and-how-to-approach-them/" target="_blank"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/319/large/Jonjo.jpg?1595368809" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632319" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/319/medium/Jonjo.jpg?1595368809" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>Well that was an easy section!</p><h3><strong>Interviews</strong></h3><p>Your portfolio, CV and cover letter will tell the employer on paper that you’re the one for the job. They're largely an analysis of technical skills. Interviews however, are a character analysis. This is why I suggest leaving the more personable parts of your application, (eg. unrelated jobs, interests and hobbies) until this stage. If everything about you has been explained in your probably-a-bit-too-long-CV or cover letter, then the initial impact of the application may pack less of a punch in an interview. </p><p>The aim is to leave a great first and last impression. With not much info to go on for what you are like face-to-face, you’ve got maximum potential in blowing them away with how you're a great person with awesome interests and valuable soft skills that you can bring to the table.</p><p>If you're on talking terms with studios, rest assured you're good enough to do the job in their eyes. They wouldn’t waste their time if they didn’t want to be involved with you. Congrats! It’s often the most nerve-racking part of the process but in reality, you’re in good hands and interviews are more like casual chats about your history. Don’t let that stop you from being professional though. Here's my advice:</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/321/large/glassdoor.jpg?1595368934" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632321" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/321/medium/glassdoor.jpg?1595368934" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>Use Glassdoor</strong></h4><p><a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm">Glassdoor</a> is a great resource that often gets slept on. Search for your desired studio. Find out what the market salary rate for your work is. Read through the reviews and get an overall feel for the studio. There’s a dedicated section where candidates describe their interviewing experience. This gives you an idea of <em>when </em>you can expect to hear back from a studio after an interview. Despite this, it’s best to take all online reviews with a pinch of salt - Metacritic and Yelp being prime examples. You can’t beat first hand experience followed by word of mouth from people you trust in my opinion. </p><p>Glassdoor is a great resource for salary negotiation. I’ve heard games make a bit of money. No one wants to be living off scraps and it’s <strong>never </strong>unreasonable to ask for a salary that covers the costs of living as well as your worth and experience. </p><h4><strong>Be ready to explain through your workflow</strong></h4><p>Breakdowns are great for this. In every interview I’ve ever had, we sat through my breakdowns and work-in-progress GIFs to understand how I approached environment building. Know your work inside out and prepare that info so you can present it up on the big screen. Communication skills come to light here. You’d do well to talk confidently about your strengths, weaknesses and what you’d do differently next time. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/322/large/Interrogation-700x300.jpg?1595369367" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632322" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/322/medium/Interrogation-700x300.jpg?1595369367" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>Dress smart-casual</strong></h4><p>A full suit is overkill but also don’t rock up in your pajamas you know? Smart-casual or even just casual dress code will do. Your invitation email will probably say this. If you have any questions then email back the HR contact- they don't bite. </p><h4><strong>No half-hearted handshakes</strong></h4><p>A firm (but not bone crushing) handshake goes a long way. It may seem old fashioned but it's still the best way to introduce yourself to strangers. Make eye contact while doing so and smile! Look like you just made it to the final round of applications because you did and it’s a big achievement in and of itself.  </p><h4><strong>There are no trick-questions</strong></h4><p>They'll have questions for you but remember - they aren’t trying to expose your flaws. They’re not trying to get you to slip up. There is no "ah-ha I got you" moment. It's a casual conversation about you, your work and your history. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/452/large/caution.jpg?1595423103" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632452" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/452/medium/caution.jpg?1595423103" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>Prepare for soft-skill questions</strong></h4><p>Tell me about a time when you overcame a big challenge? Tell me about a time when things didn’t go according to plan? How did you cope? What do you do when you have to work with someone you aren't compatible with? </p><p>If you're not ready for questions on your soft skills, you'll be left thinking on your feet. Leadership, time management, collaboration, problem-solving, communication and adaptability. These skills are what they're trying to gauge about you as they ask you these situational questions. </p><h4><strong>Relax and be yourself</strong></h4><p>Everyone gets nervous. Just remember your manners, check your ego at the door and you’ll be fine. </p><p>Similar to the golden rule of “don’t lie” (a good life tip in general), this is just a reminder to be yourself. Don’t put on a persona or put up a front. Be yourself because ultimately, that's who the studio is interested in. If all goes well, you’ll be offered to work alongside these people on a daily basis and they’re just trying to get to know you a bit better. Being yourself makes that process easier and you’ll come across as more honest and trustworthy. Just chill! Enjoy meeting the devs, taking the tours and seeing games in the making :) </p><h4><strong>Have questions for them!</strong></h4><p>What’s the studio’s stance on crunch culture? Where do they see the studio in 5 years? Who are the main competitors? What’s the unique selling point (USP) of working at the company? If I were to join, what are my responsibilities? What does the benefits package cover? Can I have a studio tour?</p><p>Having questions is essential. It’s in your best interest to gather as much information about the company as you can and get a vibe if they’re a good fit for you. Yep, you read that right. It’s a two way street. You might find out more about a studio or the projects they're working on in an interview and realise that the gig isn’t the right one for you. Always have questions. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 36.74%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/323/large/invite.jpg?1595369491" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632323" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/323/medium/invite.jpg?1595369491" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>Send follow up emails</strong></h4><p>Lastly, make good last impressions. Send a follow-up email after the interview to those that you met on the day to say thank you for the opportunity. This is a great excuse for a LinkedIn invite with an attached note. It’s a polite and professional way of rounding off the experience and it will keep your name fresh in memory for when they make the final call. </p><h4><strong>Good post-interview attitude</strong></h4><p>Usually they'll tell you in the interview when to expect a response regarding the hiring decision. If you don't hear back within a week after the interview, send a polite follow up asking about the time frame and when you'll find out the result. If you don't hear back after 2-4 weeks, send another polite email asking about the status of your application. If after that, you're still not hearing back, it's safest to assume you weren't successful and try to move on. Don't keep harassing them. Sometimes this process really does take months, especially with international applications and if you're overly aggressive with chase-ups then they might just change their mind about hiring you. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/982/large/jim.jpg?1595459216" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632982" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/982/medium/jim.jpg?1595459216" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>If you're lucky, you'll be kept in the loop throughout, whether it's with the news you were hoping for or not. If you were unsuccessful this time round, a good response is thanking them for the opportunity and asking if there's a chance for some feedback. </p><p>Job applications get easier over time. You get better in interviews and you're able to send out better applications, especially if you get feedback. Just keep going. Keep contributing to your skill set and you'll get the work you're after.   </p><p><strong style="color: rgb(241, 241, 241);font-family: inherit;font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0.015em;">Other Advice</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Apples and oranges </strong></li></ul><p>Everyone's background, education and journey vary immensely. What one person can achieve in 3 months might take you 9 and vice versa. There's a saying - apples and oranges - which means not suitable for comparison because two things are fundamentally different. Now there is a need and value in comparing yourself to others whether that's for inspiration, motivation, or sometimes, a reality check. I know I needed a few of those along the way. But that only works to a point. Comparison eventually becomes crippling and it's at that point you've gotta take a step back. Take care of yourself, refocus and restart your personal growth. It's at that point you've GOT to stop looking left and right, and just look forward.  </p><ul><li><strong>Join game art discords </strong></li></ul><p>Hang out, problem-solve and create alongside other devs. Post your work there. Many of us have these places to thank for our growth and opportunities. Some people you'll naturally click with, others you won't, and that's fine. Finding small groups of people you really enjoy the company of are golden for honest feedback and sanity checks. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/608/large/DISCORDS.jpg?1595449060" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632608" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/608/medium/DISCORDS.jpg?1595449060" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Respect people’s time!</strong></p></li></ul><p>This is a massive one! If you ask a professional for feedback, you’d better be serious about applying it and learning from their advice. There’s nothing more disheartening and frustrating than someone, typically students, asking for help and then not acting or responding to the feedback. Industry artists are usually very happy to help out and are humbled to have been approached despite being busy. Don’t sever that trust. </p><p>On the flip side and akin to the “Don’t boot kiss” rule from the <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson/blog/nz0A/guide-to-game-art-applications-cvs-and-covering-letters" target="_blank">CV and Covering Letter</a> part, try not to be over-the-top thankful, over-the-top formal or even wacky if you do get a response. I'd advise against the 'haha', 'lol' and 'dude / man / buddy' sentence suffixes with people you don't know well. Stay polite, stay professional.   </p><ul>
<li><p><strong>Create content - </strong>if you’ve got something to say, to teach or to share.<strong><br></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be active on LinkedIn -</strong> the industry uses it and it’s a great way to get your name in front of studios.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It’s fine to add soft skills on a CV  - </strong>just<strong> </strong>provide examples in your Experience section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have feedback for studios in interviews </strong>-<strong> </strong>as outside eyes are valuable and studios appreciate your ideas on what they show you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have patience</strong></p></li>
</ul><p>The successful application road is long and often unforgiving. You’ve got to be patient to survive. Keep making art you love. Keep applying feedback. Keep socialising. Everything will fall into place.</p><h3><strong>Final Useful Resources</strong></h3><ul>

</ul><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p>If job applications were a pipeline, this is the post-processing section- the final 20%. If you've gotten this far into the hiring process then congrats - you're on the path to a successful application. Technical skills carry you through your portfolio and art-tests. Soft skills will carry you through your CV, covering letter, interviews and will definitely serve you well throughout your career. </p><blockquote><p>An artist with good soft skills but lesser technical skills is easier to teach than an artist with good technical skills but poor soft skills. </p></blockquote><p>Here's part III's graphic for you to save and keep.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/633/060/large/GTGAA_Part_III.jpg?1595537863" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="633060" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/633/060/medium/GTGAA_Part_III.jpg?1595537863" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h3><strong>Downloading the Guide ...</strong></h3><p>That's the end of the series. </p><p><strong>Next week you can download the entire guide for FREE from my store when it launches on 10th August with all the accompanying graphics.</strong></p><p>Part of the reason I write these articles is because I wish these resources were easier to find when I was doing my application rounds.

        <![CDATA[<p><em>27/07/20 - <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson" target="_blank"><em>Kieran Goodson</em></a>  - 15 min read</em>   </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/537/large/part_II_02_an.jpg?1595013226" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631537" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/537/medium/part_II_02_an.jpg?1595013226" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h3><strong>Guide to Game Art Applications</strong></h3><p>Welcome back to my guide to game art applications. If you missed last week's post on <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson/blog/mY0N/guide-to-game-art-applications-portfolios-and-job-postings" target="_blank">portfolios and job postings</a>, make sure to head back and have a snoop. It's a 10 min read on the most important aspect of applications. Long story short I've compiled a guide for anyone preparing applications within the industry based on peer and personal experience. </p><p>This week, I'm combing through CV's and covering letters. This is an area that artists DREAD so I'm excited to run through some common pitfalls I see people falling into when creating them. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/572/large/part_II_header.jpg?1595015808" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631572" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/572/medium/part_II_header.jpg?1595015808" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><strong>* NOTE:</strong> These are guidelines and not hard-and-fast rules. There will always be exceptions but in my experience, these have served me and many of my industry pals very well. Let's begin.</p><h3><strong>C̶u̶r̶r̶i̶c̶u̶l̶u̶  CV's</strong></h3><p>I cannot count the number of CV's that I've seen that are over-complicated, over-designed, full of filler with spelling mistakes and self-aggrandising buzzwords. For your sake - keep it simple. The CV is a <strong>transactional </strong>text-based document, not a portfolio piece. You're efficiently providing key information here. No fancy formatting. No ostentatious graphics. A good CV is one that gets you the interview. This is your order and structure. </p><ul>
<li><p>Name</p></li>
<li><p>Contact details - portfolio hyperlink, mobile, email and location</p></li>
<li><p>2-3 line profile section</p></li>
<li><p>Technical skills</p></li>
<li><p>Relevant experience</p></li>
<li><p>Education</p></li>
<li><p>Achievements<br><br></p></li>
</ul><p>Here’s a good example of a clean CV that I found on Google. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/294/large/CV_eg.jpg?1594930762" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631294" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/294/medium/CV_eg.jpg?1594930762" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>And with that, here are your guidelines. </p><h4><strong>"Aspiring"</strong></h4><p>The absolute worst offender I see on portfolios and CV's time and time again. It triggers me so much. I'm aspiring to get in and out of the supermarket within an hour in the horror show that is 2020 but that's not my title! Everyone is aspiring to be something so drop the adjective. State the situation that best describes you and be confident about it. </p><ul>
<li><p>You're still at uni and have a taste for environment art? Your title is "Environment Art Student"</p></li>
<li><p>You just graduated and you're into characters? Your title is "Graduate Character Artist"</p></li>
<li><p>You're interning in a concept role at X Studios? Your title is "Concept Art Intern at X Studios"</p></li>
</ul><blockquote><p><strong>Just because you graduated doesn't automatically make you a Junior Artist! You have to earn those stripes!  </strong></p></blockquote><p>And don’t forget to capitalise your name and job title.</p><h4><strong>One page length ideal, two max</strong></h4><p>Your CV needs to be snappy and at entry-level you should have a one page CV. If you are an experienced artist with multiple titles under your belt, then two pages is fine - you’ll likely need the extra space to explain your history. Generally, the shorter the better. Get to the point with the most important, and most recent projects conveyed first. </p><h4><strong>Black text, white page, normal font</strong></h4><p>Fonts - pick something normal, even for your name at the top. Use bold for titles and subtitles or use a different colour. No more than two font colours; black as the default text colour and blue for links or to make info like dates more readable. Size 11 is a minimum for body text. These fonts will get you cancelled: </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/295/large/papyrus.jpg?1594930909" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631295" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/295/medium/papyrus.jpg?1594930909" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>Even Avatar, one of the highest grossing movies of all time, is <strong>inexcusable </strong>for using Papyrus. You are not exempt.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 51.77%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/589/large/avatar.jpg?1595019093" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631589" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/589/medium/avatar.jpg?1595019093" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>No photos, no age. </strong></h4><p>Don’t give a studio any reason to judge you for anything other than your work, skills and experience. </p><h4><strong>No bar graphs or charts</strong></h4><p>Just as bad as calling yourself “aspiring”, stop putting bar graphs or similar graphics on here to 'rate your skills'. What does 10/16 actually mean in terms of your knowledge? It’s so arbitrary and in my opinion, looks tacky. You do yourself a disservice and point out your flaws. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/311/large/skills.jpg?1594932225" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631311" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/311/medium/skills.jpg?1594932225" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>Goes without saying. If you don’t have experience in a software package, don’t write that you do on your CV. You’ll be asked about it in the interview. If there are doubts about your technical skill that haven’t been addressed in your portfolio, you’ll likely be given an art test. It’s worth mentioning again, that you don’t need to know every piece of software a studio uses. You’ll learn on the job, especially in entry-level roles. A lot of skills are transferable and fundamentals are more important than 'syntax' of a program. A good attitude towards learning is very attractive. </p><h4><strong>Self-aggrandising buzzwords and SHOW, don’t tell</strong></h4><p>Lose the CV buzzwords. I’m talking about self-descriptors here - “capable”, “self-motivated”, “proficient”, “hard-working” or “dedicated”. They’re pretty meaningless at this point because recruiters have seen this written on every CV that comes their way. Let them judge what you are - just present them with the facts. Any employer worth their salt will be able to tell from your application if you actually are any of those things. Don’t tell them, show them. </p><p><em>For example,</em></p><ul>
<li>You ran support sessions at your uni? From that I can tell that you’re “self-motivated”- you don’t need to say “I’m self-motivated”.<br><br>
</li>
<li>You’ve listed industry software under skills and demonstrated that in your portfolio - I can tell that you’re “capable” otherwise you wouldn’t have listed that software in the first place.<br><br>
</li>
<li>You won an optional university game-jam? I can tell you’re “passionate” and “hard-working”. You get the picture. Don’t tell them, show them.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><h4><strong>Reduce the word count </strong></h4><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/313/large/Cut_The_Fat.jpg?1594932707" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631313" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/313/medium/Cut_The_Fat.jpg?1594932707" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>Here’s an example of where you can trim the fat:<em> </em></p><p><em><strong>"My current role as a 3D generalist involves everything from…” </strong></em></p><p>Here the applicant has spent 10 words and given me no new information. I know you’re a 3D Generalist because you've said in your job title, your profile paragraph and directly above this description. I know what software you use because you’ve listed it in the skills section. Cut to the chase! Here’s how it looks trimmed from 35 words down to 10, providing the same information. </p><p><em>“Modelling, retopologizing, optimizing, texturing, animating and rigging assets for AR.” </em></p><p>This seems pedantic but every word counts and white space is desirable! They don’t need to be full sentences. Bullet points are perfect for this. By writing concisely and avoiding repetition you’ll come across more confident and you’ll be saving everyone’s time. </p><h4><strong>Personal projects &gt; unrelated jobs</strong></h4><p>For most, part-time jobs and interests contribute to a great deal of fluff. </p><p>When I got my junior job I didn’t have any relevant industry experience. I’d been a cleaner, a cashier and kitchen staff at a local bar. I even some money doing manual labour for a neighbour. </p><blockquote><p>Instead, I chose to describe two personal portfolio projects and my final year dissertation on my CV under “Experience”. </p></blockquote><p>Why? Because I thought to myself if I was employing me, I’d prefer to read about those rather than how I “built rapport as a cashier with customers”. I mean, I did build rapport with customers, but I’d rather show those soft skills in the interview as opposed to my CV. Prioritise industry experience first, then any project experience, then relevant education. These should come before unrelated jobs.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/315/large/PTJ.jpg?1594932964" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631315" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/315/medium/PTJ.jpg?1594932964" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>If you have none of the above, then describe unrelated jobs from the angle of what you learned from the experience, and how those skills are relevant to a games job. I can guess what you did as a cashier but so what? Always bring it back to this: </p><blockquote><p>How does this tick a box on the job posting?  </p></blockquote><h4><strong>Leave hobbies and interests to the letter or interview</strong></h4><p>As for hobbies and interests, I’d leave them out of the CV. A line in the covering letter does the trick and is where you can link it back to how it's interesting to the company. A little bit of mystery goes a long way. A lot of the fun in an interview comes from the studio getting to know you as a person. This is the perfect time to wow them with the fact you’re a sick guitar player, you’ve climbed mountains or you’re a medal-winning athlete. </p><h4><strong>Tailor your CV and Covering Letter</strong></h4><p>Similar to your portfolio, your CV needs to look a lot like that job posting. Don't shotgun the same CV to every studio. You need to reconsider and reshuffle parts of your application around because each studio requires different things. Adapt your descriptions to cater for what they're looking for.</p><p>For example:</p><ul>
<li>Sony Santa Monica made God of War. Lots of sculpted set pieces and ruins. Highlight your ZBrush work.</li>
<li>Naughty Dog made TLOU and Uncharted. Apocalyptic and adventure games. They'll want to see foliage experience.</li>
<li>Cloud Imperium make Star Citizen. So big it has it's own famous workflow. You get the picture. </li>

Triple check your spelling and grammar. If you’re unsure, Google it. These are common ones to check for. </p><ul>
<li><p>Using "A" vs. "An"</p></li>

<li><p>They’re, their and there</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use commas when you should be using full-stops</p></li>
<li><p>No capital letters in the middle of sentences, unless for a name or proper noun </p></li>
</ul><h4><strong>References</strong></h4><p>“References available on request” is a redundant statement. There’s no need to append this to the bottom of your CV. Save the white space. You don’t need to give them permission to ask ;) If you have some heavy hitting reference names, then mention them in the cover letter or interview. They’ll email you for your references after if they’re serious about hiring you.</p><h4><strong>Achievements</strong></h4><p>After your experience and education, don’t forget these. Drafted for the Rookie Awards? Mention it. Published an 80 Level or Experience Points breakdown? Those hold weight - append it. On a podcast episode? Add the link. Recruiters want to know what makes you special. This section is where you can shine the most. </p><p><em>PS: Don’t dump the whole URL on the page- hyperlink the words! </em></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 74.85%;"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/316/large/exp.jpg?1594933278" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631316" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/316/medium/exp.jpg?1594933278" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>Don’t write “Curriculum Vitae” at the top. </strong></h4><p>They aren't stupid and Latin doesn't get you the job ...</p><h4><strong>Export CV and Covering Letter as PDF</strong></h4><p>This has all happened to us at one point. Picture this. You're writing up something in Word and you're pretty happy with your masterpiece. You decide it needs pictures so you drag and drop a jpeg in. BOOM. Before you know it, half your essay has been yeeted out the room faster than a puppy with no potty training 💩</p><p>Often, the same thing happens when sending files online. The studio might be using a different word editor or version to you. When they open up your files on their side, you don't want the formatting to change otherwise you risk having an unreadable application. Exporting as PDF is the safest way to ensure they see exactly what you’ve sent off. Plus, it can’t be edited by anyone so your document remains safe.</p><h3><strong>Covering Letters</strong></h3><p>Okay, potentially the most dreaded part of the process. Your portfolio and CV will be looked at first followed by your covering letter, if it even gets read at all. That being said, the covering letter, no matter how old-fashioned, is a chance for you to formally introduce yourself, expand on the details in your CV (within reason), and explain why you’re a valuable candidate for the job. Most application portals require you to upload one so it’s worth discussing. Here's my advice. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 73.03%;"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/318/large/cover_letters.jpg?1594934520" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631318" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/318/medium/cover_letters.jpg?1594934520" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>&lt; One page length </strong></h4><p>Writing, especially at length, isn’t everyone's cup of tea. It’s a good job that shorter covering letters are preferred. It's not as tricky as it seems and you don't have to be a literary God to write a good one. 200-400 words or up to one page is ideal. I wouldn't say there's even game-industry specific advice when it comes to these letters so stick to the standard format. <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/cover-letter-format-2060205">Check out the template above</a>.</p><h4><strong>Address the letter to someone</strong></h4><p>Do some research on the studio website or LinkedIn and try to find the main hiring manager to address the letter to. Sometimes the job posting says who authored it. It makes the application more personal as opposed to “Dear Hiring Manager / To Whom It May Concern”. That being said, if you can’t find a name then don’t stress because applications likely get passed between the hiring team.</p><h4><strong>Avoid the "I've been playing games since the womb" line</strong></h4><p>There's no need for the life story. Everyone involved is passionate about games and it's not a competition. It's a classic application line and one I've been guilty of dropping but try to avoid it as it's a mega cliché. </p><h4><strong>Don't boot kiss</strong></h4><p>If you haven't played a studio’s games then that's okay! It doesn’t hurt to have familiarity, and you should always do your research beforehand, but you don't need to be a super fan to be a successful candidate. If you are a frequent player of their titles then mention so but remember, you're selling yourself, your skills and how valuable you are to the studio - not bending the knee!    </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/320/large/bendtheknee.jpg?1594935360" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631320" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/320/medium/bendtheknee.jpg?1594935360" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>How to sign a letter off</strong></h4><p>Use "Yours sincerely" when you <strong>know </strong>the person you are addressing, i.e. Mr. Smith.</p><p>Use "Yours faithfully" when you <strong>don't know</strong> the person or starting your letter with Dear Sir / Madam, or a similar construction.</p><p>However, these sign-offs are used less often these days so a more casual sign off such as “Kind Regards” or “Best Wishes” should be fine too.</p><h4><strong>Summary</strong></h4><p>As mentioned earlier, good CVs and covering letters are ones that get you interviews. Use these guidelines as a starting point and miss the many pitfalls of writing applications. Keep it short, keep it sweet and your portfolio will take you the rest of the way.

I remember the struggles of casting out job applications and the rush of getting bites back from studios. It was difficult to get any form of feedback after applying and responses were hard to come by. Being ghosted by studios was the worst feeling in the world. It took me 11 months of applications and portfolio building to get a job.</p><blockquote><p>So I can still empathise a lot when students and grads message me every week asking for CV, portfolio and job application advice. </p></blockquote><p>Due to this, I'm always giving out the same feedback over and over again so today I’m presenting a concise<strong>, </strong>easy to follow three part guide for anyone preparing job applications within the games industry, particularly for those at entry-level. </p><p>*Quick anecdote. When I was applying away and trying to break into the industry my Dad, an over-middle-aged old fashioned fella, always used to tell me to phone up the studio and speak directly to the CEO. Even better if I could go to the studio and speak to people directly, with my CV on paper in hand and ready to be distributed. As I explained to him, we live in the 21st century now and that's just not how it works. There's a process. That's what this guide is all about - walking you through that application process and pointing out all the do's and don'ts along the way.  </p><p>In the series, I'll be covering the following:</p><ul>
<li><p>Portfolios</p></li>
<li><p>Job Postings</p></li>
<li><p>CV's</p></li>
<li><p>Covering Letters</p></li>
<li><p>Art Tests</p></li>
<li><p>Interviews</p></li>
<li><p>Other Advice</p></li>
<li><p>Useful Resources</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Note that the following are guidelines and not hard-and-fast rules. </strong>There will always be exceptions but in my experience, these have served me and many of my industry pals very well. Let's begin. If I can help anyone to not make the same mistakes I did, then it’ll be a good thing to put out. So here's the first part - <strong>portfolios and job postings.</strong></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/570/large/part_I_header.jpg?1595015766" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631570" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/570/medium/part_I_header.jpg?1595015766" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h3><strong>Portfolios</strong></h3><p>The first set of eyes on your portfolio / CV / cover letter is usually NOT an artist. That's not to diss that first set of eyes, but it’s a poignant reminder that they're not soaking in your killer textures to begin with. They're gaining a rapid first impression and filtering your application into <strong>YES </strong>/ <strong>NO </strong>/ <strong>MAYBE </strong>piles. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4CVKbVtTsc" style="width: 76.52%;" target="_blank"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/069/large/You're_Not_The_Boss_of_Me_Now.jpg?1594849401" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631069" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/069/medium/You're_Not_The_Boss_of_Me_Now.jpg?1594849401" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><blockquote><p>Your portfolio is the most important part of your application. </p></blockquote><p>There tends to be hundreds of candidates for any one entry-level role and with game courses being offered at most universities, the application piles are only getting larger. These recruiters are balls-to-the-walls busy. So get to the point. Make the process of reviewing your portfolio easy and streamlined. Don't leave room for questions. Give yourself a higher chance of getting a second look at. Here's the list:</p><h4><strong>Avoid custom websites (use ArtStation)</strong></h4><p>They're not worth the cost, the setup time or the risk of missing a job opportunity because you annoyed a recruiter with a missing hyperlink. <a href="https://www.polygon-academy.com/why-your-portfolio-needs-to-be-on-artstation/">Read Tim Simpson's post </a>on why your portfolio needs to be on ArtStation. Your audience, the market and the opportunities are here on ArtStation. Don't miss out on the exposure from posting new work, the resources or the community. It’s unrivalled and is the best place to be as a game artist.</p><h4><strong>Pick a discipline and go</strong></h4><p>Uni coursework is usually all over the place in content and quality, especially if you take a generic games course like I did. You HAVE to pick a direction and go. In most studios, you can't do 2D and 3D. You can't do characters, environments and vehicles. You've got to pick - (Exceptions may apply in indie or mobile sectors). Most larger studios have dedicated jobs for those so learn about the different disciplines and specialise. You don't need to know everything, and you aren't expected to. But you must know where you want to go and your portfolio must reflect that.<br><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 65.32%;"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/070/large/env_art_special.jpg?1594849649" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631070" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/070/medium/env_art_special.jpg?1594849649" class="img-responsive" /></a><br>
</div><p>An "Environment Artist" is it's own discipline but will often overlap with a lot of the other responsibilities you see above. Most studios will split these roles into dedicated jobs so you can even specialise further. It’s worth noting that often or not, job titles and responsibilities will change from studio to studio so read the job posting carefully.</p><p>What I'm getting at is if your portfolio looks like...</p><p><strong>... A realistic prop, a vehicle, a character, an Insta shot of homemade turkey twizzlers and a charcoal cave sketch of your nan's cat... </strong></p><p><strong>✘  </strong>               … It's not clear what you want to do for a living.</p><p><strong>... A realistic prop, a vehicle and a character ...</strong></p><p><strong>?   </strong>              … It's a little better but you're still straddling between two or three different disciplines. </p><p><strong>... A realistic prop, two environments and three tileable materials</strong></p><p><strong>✓  </strong>               … It's crystal clear what you're interested in and why you're applying for this position.</p><h4><strong>Tailor your Portfolio</strong></h4><p>A contentious "rule". If you're laser-focused on joining a particular studio, then create a portfolio and build a skillset that will get you there. Google and YouTube your way around understanding what tools they use, which workflows they adopt and socialise with those devs. </p><p>If you don't have a particular studio in mind then don't worry, most won't at entry-level. Create artwork that inspires you, in the style that you enjoy the most. Then, write down 15 studios you'd be happy to work at. Organise them into your top 5, next 5 and last 5. This will give you something to aim at. Don’t ever limit yourself in where you want to apply. Reach for the sky. Be prepared to face rejection along the way. But most importantly, enjoy creating artwork for your portfolio. </p><h4><strong>Stills before cinema</strong></h4><p>The still render of a scene needs to be presented first, and then a video afterwards if there is one. This is more of a preference but here's why I recommend it. </p><p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Still renders are essentia</strong>l in showing off most 3D work. Videos and fly-throughs are largely optional (but nice extras)</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>It's easier to study </strong>and breakdown someone's skill level from a still image. It's particularly jarring if good artwork is shown off with bad video work. Nothing is being hidden with crazy camera movements, animations or dodgy jump cuts. Good cinematography is an entire discipline in and of itself. Make it easier for those recruiters and leads checking out your work. </p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong> You want to produce a "wow" first impression</strong> when someone opens up your project for a closer look. That's harder to achieve when the first thing the viewer is met with is a play button or a buffering YouTube / Vimeo link. I recommend high quality looping GIF's or ArtStation's new 4K 1 minute videos. I've not had the chance to play with the latter but from what I've seen it's a great new addition. </p><p>If you're an animator or VFX artist then you rely solely on video to show off your motion work. That's fine, show that off first before any still images. But if you're a traditional game artist then you don't <em>need </em>video to show off your skills. Stills come first in that case. Don't get me wrong, videos are essential for giving further context to artwork - environment fly-through's, character turntables, light reacting to materials as a few examples - just not before stills. </p><p><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/028/large/alex_zieglmier.jpg?1595247009" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632028" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/028/medium/alex_zieglmier.jpg?1595247009" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://www.artstation.com/bigziegel" target="_blank">Alex Zieglmeir</a> demonstrates this perfectly - his gorgeous render first, then his fly-through second. Brownie points if it autoplays. The less clicks the better.</p><h4><strong>Quality &gt; Quantity</strong></h4><p>Cliché but it rings true. In my personal experience, it rang very true. Making one polished portfolio piece takes you further than three mediocre pieces. Create a piece of art that showcases your skills and displays your application of art fundamentals, understanding of design and overall artistic flair. Less is more!</p><h4><strong>Axe old work</strong></h4><p>It’s tough, but you have to detach yourself from your work. Be savage with your own portfolio because the chances are if you're a grad, your student work won't be the best that you can produce - once you've got something new out, chop the old stuff.  If you can't assess, get a professional opinion on it. "But I want to show that I can do x, y, z" is a common motivator behind keeping older work and that's fine - but in the eyes of a recruiter, you're only as strong as your weakest portfolio piece. </p><blockquote><p>Keep older portfolio work in a hidden blog or PDF in case you're ever asked to show it in an interview. It will show you are capable and humble enough to self-analyse your own work and determine where your strengths are. Sometimes the juxtaposition of older and newer work is jarring and you may blow the studio away by demonstrating how far you’ve come. It did for me. </p></blockquote><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/067/large/before.jpg?1594848663" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631067" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/067/medium/before.jpg?1594848663" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oO9kKz" target="_blank"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/066/large/after.jpg?1594848659" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631066" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/066/medium/after.jpg?1594848659" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><h4><strong>Presentation!</strong></h4><p>A constantly overlooked part of the process for newer artists. Excellent presentation can make mediocre work look great. The flip side is that terrible presentation can ruin excellent work. Do not spend months crafting 3D artwork to then only spend an hour or two on your renders. Learn how to use the three point lighting system. Explore different renderers in your engine, Marmoset or modelling package. Pick up on some do’s and don’ts from any of the great AS Learning courses that are available.   </p><blockquote><p>Take 30 renders and boil them down to the three to five best shots. <strong>Each render MUST have a motivation behind it </strong>- a new perspective, a point of interest, an asset in isolation. Most of the time you're showing far too much, diluting good work with filler shots and risking showing off weaker parts of your work.</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Consistent thumbnails</strong></h4><p>Having these gives your portfolio a professional, cohesive look to the body of your work. There are many ways to do this. I like to use clear renders and dark borders on each thumbnail. </p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/073/large/KG_port_strip.jpg?1594850012" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631073" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/073/medium/KG_port_strip.jpg?1594850012" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p>If you’re using logos and text, then keep them in the same place on each render. These are <a href="https://www.artstation.com/jeremyh">Jeremy Huxley’s</a> materials from The Last of Us Part II. Note how each material is also lit and presented with the same neutral lighting too.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/075/large/JH_port_strip.jpg?1594850140" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631075" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/075/medium/JH_port_strip.jpg?1594850140" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil">It’s not uncommon for material artists to group their material artwork in biomes or order them by colour gradient which also looks excellent. Here’s <a href="https://www.artstation.com/dete">Daniel Thiger’s</a> portfolio.</div><h4 class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><div class="media-asset-container media-image"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/077/large/daniel_thiger.jpg?1594850188" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631077" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/077/medium/daniel_thiger.jpg?1594850188" class="img-responsive" /></a></div></h4><h4 class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><strong>Avoid fan art branding</strong></h4><p class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil">A common problem with student work in particular. Fan art itself is fine. In fact, studios enjoy fan art as it shows how closely you're able to replicate something from those games. However, don't put the game or company's logo in the thumbnail if you didn't work on that production. It's a bit misleading and clickbaity and may not be appreciated by those who actually did work on the game. If you do go ahead with it, just make sure it's super obvious and the post clearly says "Fan Art" on the thumbnail, in the title and in the description.  </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/549/large/FANART.jpg?1595443347" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632549" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/549/medium/FANART.jpg?1595443347" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4 class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><strong>Fill in your portfolio’s ‘About’ section</strong></h4><p>Because it is very slick. Because it’s more professional if you do so. Because you can make yourself more hireable if you provide all your info up front, attached directly to your artwork. Don’t make a recruiter have to Google your name or dive through application emails to find your stuff. Your AS portfolio is your homepage and your online launchpad as an artist. </p><h3><strong>Job Postings</strong></h3><p>Now onto job postings, with a couple of big things to note.</p><h4><strong>Using job postings as a checklist</strong></h4><p>As mentioned before, studios have different names for different roles. An Environment Artist at one place will be a set-dresser at the next. Use the job requirements as a checklist for your portfolio and work towards filling the gaps. When viewing your portfolio, ask yourself, am I showing everything that's being asked of me here? </p><blockquote><p>Don't wait until you have the "perfect" portfolio before you apply. Everyone's portfolio is a work in progress and will have strengths and weaknesses. You won't be showing ALL of these skills and you're not expected to, but the more the merrier. The less you leave to question, the better your chances.</p></blockquote><h4><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 71.1%;"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/068/large/Job_posting.jpg?1594848678" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="631068" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/631/068/medium/Job_posting.jpg?1594848678" class="img-responsive" /></a><br>
</div></h4><h4><strong>Ignore the line "You need X years of experience". Apply anyway.</strong></h4><p>This phrase is to scare off those who are half-serious about applying. Intern and Junior roles can be few and far between so you'll sometimes have to apply through postings that are aimed at more experienced artists. If your work is desirable to the studio then you'll hear back in some form. Best case scenario is that they'll create a job for you to fill. Worst case scenario is you don't hear back, and chances are you're building a tolerance for that radio silence so it won't sting so much. </p><blockquote><p>Rule of thumb - if you're in contact with them then you're showing promise and succeeding in the job application process.</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>Your portfolio is the proof in the pudding that you've got what it takes to do the job. Your portfolio is what will attract studios to you, rather than the other way around. Your portfolio is 70% of the key to getting that role you're after. The other 30% is what we'll be going over in the next two weeks. Overall, portfolios are always a work in progress and will never be perfect. Scrap perfection; chase progression. Take your time with your artwork and it'll show. One thing at a time. Here's part I's graphic for you to save out and keep safe.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/550/large/GTGAA_AS_Part_I.jpg?1595443496" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="632550" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/632/550/medium/GTGAA_AS_Part_I.jpg?1595443496" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h3><strong>Downloading the Guide ...</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson/blog/nz0A/guide-to-game-art-applications-cvs-and-covering-letters" target="_blank">In part II, I'll be combing through some common <strong>CV and covering letter</strong> trip-ups and explaining the do's and don'ts of concise written work</a>.

A hot, triadic web of confusion, frustration and $$$ for many aspiring developers. How do you get into the industry as a game artist? Do you need to have an artistic background? Do you need to know everything in the pipeline to get in? Ross Baxter hosts me on the Student Art podcast and we dive into the debate and more.

After moving for my first job in the industry, having a proper routine has been vital for adapting to studio life.<br><br></p><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHT9UN3Tfpw&amp;t=420s">7:00</a> - Biography and Inspirations </em></p><p>Outlining my history with games and film throughout my childhood and adolescence. Outside of casual sketching and a deep interest in street art, I never came from an art background. I never took it seriously as an academic subject. It was only after my first year 3D module at university that I realised I wanted to do game art for a living.<br><br></p><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHT9UN3Tfpw&amp;t=691s">11:31</a> - Cinematics </em></p><p>I gather that most people are interested in films but after taking Media Studies at A-Level, I fostered a deep fascination for how films are put together: costume, editing, lighting, set-dressing and sound. Ross and I discuss how to approach environment flythroughs and directing cinematics.<br><br></p><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHT9UN3Tfpw&amp;t=1027s">17:07</a> - Foliage </em></p><p>An audience member asks how I tackled foliage in my "<a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oO9kKz" target="_blank">Those Who Mourn</a>" environment.

If I could go back I wish I'd learned more about the pipeline and delved into more artsy areas of game dev. Independence, soft skills and writing are some things that I did take away from university. To re-iterate once again, you must go above and beyond to learn at home and build your portfolio to an industry standard.

We all feel like we have 10932 things to learn and we need to get better. That's natural. Treat presentations and job interviews like Dragon's Den.

Last week I had the wicked opportunity to chat to <a href="https://www.artstation.com/alexbeddows" target="_blank">Alex Beddows</a> on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA" target="_blank">Game Dev Discussion podcast</a> and tackle the chunky theme of storytelling in environment art. We also discussed advice for junior devs, how to approach networking, and constantly asking <strong>WHY </strong>when crafting meaningful game art.

<strong>Podcast Overview</strong><br><br>
</h4><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=98s"><em>1:38</em></a><em> - Post-University </em></p><p>A brief run-down on my experience at university and how I entered the games industry.<br><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=302s"><em>5:02</em></a><em> - Networking with LinkedIn </em></p><p>My two cents on LinkedIn and how important I think it is to have a professional voice as an unknown student. As an aspiring developer, it's important to be engaging with your target audience, AKA industry players and recruiters who are always keeping an eye on the upcoming talent. No voice = no opportunities. We touch on the right, and the wrong approach to networking.<br><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=688s"><em>11:28</em></a><em> - Putting the SOCIAL in Social Media</em><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>We're not robots. We're living breathing beings with thoughts and feelings so why network like one? On the back of the LinkedIn topic, we delve into how useful Twitter, Instagram and YouTube can be in starting conversation as well as getting your name out there.<br><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=777s"><em>12:57</em></a><em> - Discord, Polycount and 80 LEVEL</em><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>Three key resources that can boost an artist's chances. I managed to get spotted by industry publisher 80 LEVEL as I took to Polycount to ask for feedback. It was only by putting work-in-progress shots out there that I got a chance to show my work on their site. Right place at the right time. To this day I KNOW this opportunity helped me get my first job.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 65.62%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/479/997/large/4.80lv.jpg?1564437967" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="479997" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/479/997/medium/4.80lv.jpg?1564437967" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=960s"><em>16:00</em></a><em> - First 6 weeks at Rebellion and advice for aspiring developers </em></p><p>I give you an insight into my first six weeks in the game industry. When I was trying to break in, I wish I'd heard more first-hand accounts of how people did it and what the day-to-day of an environment artist's role actually looked like.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=1371s"><em>22:51</em></a><em> - Leadership, teamwork and raw passion </em></p><p>After voicing my deeper appreciation for the heart, soul and sacrifice that goes into games, Alex asked me what ingredients I think goes into a cohesive and successful video game. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=1582s"><em>26:22</em></a><em> - Critique and Feedback </em></p><p>A must for anyone and everyone who wishes to get better at well ... anything. These two minutes cover our views on how to take feedback on board, how to give it, and how to apply it. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=1704s"><em>28:24</em></a><em> - Asking WHY when creating well-designed environments </em></p><p>The juicy middle portion of the podcast. I explain to Alex how I'm constantly asking myself WHY when I make decisions about my environments. One answer is because it forces you to make informed, logical decisions based on the universe you are creating. Another is because good design makes art more readable which is essential for 3D game spaces. This was my favourite segment from the talk.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=2200s"><em>36:40</em></a><em> - Storytelling devices and borrowing from cinema </em></p><p>The big screen. The 16x9's. The film industry. This is why I'm addicted to composition and why I'll continue to study film. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise-en-sc%C3%A8ne" target="_blank">MISE-EN-SCENE!</a> It fuelled my creativity as a young teenager who was interested in cameras and video editing and I'll always turn to movies as inspiration for great storytelling.

The feels you get when you look at well-composed art or after a rollercoaster of a film or a moment in a game that's just had a huge plot-twist. This is the unexplainable, abstract human stuff that keeps us engaged and I reckon it's got something to do with how emotions are targetted.  </p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=2862s"><em>47:42</em></a><em> - The Untrained Eye </em></p><p>The benefit of getting an outsider's perspective on your work.

It's not because I love writing, but rather I love discussing ideas. Words are just the medium. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9FyIvB-nMA&amp;t=3580s"><em>59:40</em></a><em> - The future </em></p><p>A closing segment on what I see myself doing in the near future with personal work and blogs. </p><p><br>I had a blast being on the podcast so I'd like to say thanks again to <a href="https://www.artstation.com/alexbeddows" target="_blank">Alex </a>for hosting me, and an extended thanks to <a href="http://%E2%80%8Bhttps%3A//www.artstation.com/dinusty%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B" target="_blank">Jeremy Estrellado</a> and the crew over in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/5Qe3Skg" target="_blank">DiNusty Empire Discord</a> who continue to run a brilliant community of highly talented artists.

</div><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/456/061/large/Untitled-1.jpg?1561639539" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="456061" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/456/061/medium/Untitled-1.jpg?1561639539" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil">This post follows on from <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson/blog/9VmL/research-12-understanding-players-with-personality-psychology">part one</a> of this two-part series. There I introduce you to player psychology for game design and marketing and explore past research that dives into player behaviour, emotions and motivations before prefacing my own academic investigation. If you haven't read it, head back for some context around what I'll be diving into now.<br><br>The following models are the product of data collected during my dissertation research at Coventry University, as part of the BSc Games Technology course.</div><h3><strong>The Player Persona models for Game Design and Marketing</strong></h3><h4 class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil">
<br><strong>The Aims</strong>
</h4><ul>
<li>To learn how personality influences player motivations and preferences for genre and design elements</li>
<li>To explore if personality psychology could be used to understand consumer behaviour and engagement with game-related content</li>
<li>To provide past player research with statistical evidence through empirical quantitative research</li>
</ul><h4>
<br><strong>An Empathetic Toolkit</strong>
</h4><p>By thinking about the needs of personas based on real personality traits, developers may be able to understand what a real player needs - an empathetic toolkit. In this context, personas are understood to be a <em>representation</em> of players, similar to play-styles which are dynamic and vary according to the in-game situation. Personas should be treated as facets of design and marketing. </p><blockquote><h4>You may identify yourself with multiple personas. <strong>That's the point!</strong> Real people are far more complicated and diverse and don't accurately fit into a single 'type' or 'group'.</h4></blockquote><p>The following frameworks consider what players are motivated by in-game, how they approach the decision to play or buy a game as well as which game-related content, events and products are desirable.</p><h3>
<strong>The Game Design Persona (GDP) framework. </strong><br><br>
</h3><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/884/large/persona_logo_design_LOGOS.jpg?1560280479" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="440884" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/884/medium/persona_logo_design_LOGOS.jpg?1560280479" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br>The design personas are based on the empirical results found in this investigation. They represent statistically correlated personality traits, design preferences and player motivations. Meet the gang.<br><br></p><div>

<h4 class="media-asset-container media-image fr-fil text-center"><strong>The Social Competitor</strong></h4>
<p class="media-asset-container media-image fr-fil text-center"><em><strong>Achievement Focused</strong></em><strong><br></strong><br>Fuelled by the excitement of fast-paced, competitive gameplay. Persistent against obstacles and tough opposition, they will seek to defeat the competition and are motivated to come out on top, even if it takes causing a little havoc to do so. <strong>The Social Competitor</strong> likely uses the game as a way of socialising as they take advantage of in-game chat options.<br><br></p>
<div class="media-asset-container media-image"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/802/large/Solo_explorer.jpg?1560276521" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="440802" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/802/medium/Solo_explorer.jpg?1560276521" class="img-responsive" /></a><h4 class="text-center"><strong>The Solo Explorer </strong></h4>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Adventure Focused</strong></em><strong><br></strong></p>
<p class="text-center">A highly curious persona, <strong>the Solo Explorer</strong> enjoys playing single-player modes the most. Likely to enjoy the randomness and unpredictability of games, this persona prefers to play in a non-linear fashion with the freedom to play in various ways.<br><br></p>
<div class="media-asset-container"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/799/large/Synergist.jpg?1560276502" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="440799" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/799/medium/Synergist.jpg?1560276502" class="img-responsive" /></a></div>
<h4 class="text-center"><strong>The Synergist</strong></h4>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Coop Focused</strong></em><br><br>Thriving on the social interaction like the competitive counterpart, <strong>the Synergist</strong> is highly agreeable and prefers to work together in cooperative experiences. But don't be fooled, this persona will work hard to achieve their goals with the conscientiousness personality trait.<br><br></p>
</div>

<h4 class="text-center">
<div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable text-center"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/805/large/Escapist.jpg?1560276545" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="440805" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/805/medium/Escapist.jpg?1560276545" class="img-responsive" /></a></div>
<strong>The Escapist<br></strong>
</h4>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Immersion Focused</strong></em><strong><br></strong><br>A sucker for a good story, <strong>the Escapist</strong> is invested in interesting characters, personalities and plot-lines. This persona wants to be immersed in another age, place or world.<br><br></p>
</div><div>

<h4 class="text-center"><strong>The Open World Artist </strong></h4>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Creativity Focused </strong></em></p>
</div><p class="text-center">This persona enjoys making the game truly theirs. Big fans of open-world environments, the <strong>Open World Artist</strong> likely enjoys the freedom these games allow them to play around in. Customisation is important whether that's changing aesthetic elements in the game (colours, skins, outfits) or game options - notably the difficulty setting. They enjoy being able to improve character stats, accumulate resources / currency and the excitement of pursuing the rarest items, skins and weapons in the game.<br><br></p><h4 class="media-asset-container media-image text-center"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/800/large/Strat.jpg?1560276513" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="440800" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/440/800/medium/Strat.jpg?1560276513" class="img-responsive" /></a><br><strong>The Strategic Collector </strong>
</h4><div>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Mastery Focused</strong></em><br><br><strong>The Collector </strong>is mainly motivated by strategy, naturally thinking before acting in-game. They appreciate practice modes, likely where they sharpen their skills for the real deal. Powerful in-game items go hand in hand with this preference as are collectibles for this persona.<br><br></p>
<h3>
<strong>The Game Marketing Persona (GMP) framework</strong><br><br>
</h3>
<div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/093/large/persona_logo_marketing_LOGOS.jpg?1560364306" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="442093" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/093/medium/persona_logo_marketing_LOGOS.jpg?1560364306" class="img-responsive" /></a></div>
<p>The marketing personas are based on the empirical results found in this investigation. They represent statistically correlated personality traits, influences on buyer / consumer behaviour and engagement with game-related content and products. Get a load of this lot.</p>

</h4>
<div><p class="text-center"><em>Reputation Focused</em></p></div>
<div><p class="text-center">A loyal persona who is largely influenced by friends and family when it comes to deciding what to play. If someone a friend or family member is playing and recommends it, so will <strong>The Faithful. </strong>Positive ratings and reviews are also influential and is reflective of this personas natural neuroticism trait. The Faithful want to make a safe bet when investing time and money into a game.<br><br></p></div>
<div><h4 class="text-center">
<div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/078/large/available.jpg?1560363432" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="442078" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/078/medium/available.jpg?1560363432" class="img-responsive" /></a></div>
<br><strong>The Availability-Dependent </strong>
</h4></div>
<div>
<div><p class="text-center"><em>Game Focused</em></p></div>
<div><p class="text-center">Not much sways the buying decision for<strong> the Availability-Dependent.</strong> If they fancy a game, they'll get it ... provided that they can. Most influenced by exactly that- availability. If this persona can purchase a physical copy of a game for multiple platforms and is of the correct age rating, it's theirs.<br><br></p></div>
<div>
<div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/101/large/engager.jpg?1560364758" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="442101" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/101/medium/engager.jpg?1560364758" class="img-responsive" /></a></div>
<h4 class="text-center"><strong>The Engager </strong></h4>
<p class="text-center"><em>Product Focused</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-center">Very much a content and product focused persona, <strong>the Engager's</strong> sphere of attention spans further than just the game. Artwork, box-sets, documentaries, figurines, guide books, podcasts, and soundtracks will keep this persona buzzing about the game, even after "completion". Pre-order bonuses and downloadable content will also keep them coming back for more.  <br><br></p>

<h4 class="text-center">
<br><strong>The Practical Enthusiast </strong>
</h4>
<p class="text-center"><em>Event Focused</em></p>

<p class="text-center">A pragmatic persona, <strong>the Enthusiast </strong>will want hands-on experience with a game before purchasing. Alpha and beta runs of a game are an attractive taster of what could be to come provided the game is ready or right for them. Likely to be a serious gamer, the Enthusiast participates and/or watches highly competitive gameplay such as eSports. Twitch streaming, "Let's Play's" and walkthrough video content are popular with this persona and engagement stretches to industry events like Comic-Con, E3 and GDC. Game studio tours? The Enthusiast is in!<br><br></p>

</div>
<div>
<p class="text-center">Influenced by celebrities and marketing campaigns on social media, the Popular Endorser is probably the most impressionable of the personas. Replayability is a big influence when it comes to deciding what to play and 'evergreen' games may resonate most here. This persona engages with game-branded consumer goods, interactive media such as polls, quizzes, surveys, and even clothing.<br><br></p>
<h4>
<strong>Game Dev Process &amp; Furthering the Project</strong><br><br>
</h4>
<p>In summary, the research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extends past theoretical player research with fresh empirical data</li>
<li>Finds scientific correlations between personality traits crossed with game design and game marketing methods</li>
<li>Innovates on past player modelling techniques, utilising personas as a more flexible method of player representation </li>
<li>Presents two persona frameworks based on empirical data: one for game design and one for game marketing, the latter being an area of research that has not been thoroughly academically explored </li>
<li>Speculates potential links between psychological traits, preferred social media platforms, and modes of media consumption, a promising area for content-marketing<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This study has reinforced past theoretical models highlighting the notable patterns of behaviour and preference in players. There are clear similarities between the GDP and GDM models and the research conducted by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson/blog/9VmL/research-12-understanding-players-with-personality-psychology" target="_blank">Richard Bartle and Nick Yee</a>. Although the personas presented are empirical, they should be taken with a grain of salt. </p>
<p>The results are based on a limited pool of players, most of the same age and nationality. The investigation ought to be repeated on a larger scale. If results are found to be reliable, the effectiveness of these models can be quantifiably measured in real development scenarios.<br><br>In addition, having an empirical psychological model at the heart of game design and game marketing phases would <em>seem </em>like a ticket to riches. But proving that particular personality traits lead to the enjoyment of particular games, or that traits can be used to predict consumer behaviour is a big ask. There are a tonne of other variables at play here. Demographics, age, gender, past game experiences, brand reputation, and societal influences are just some factors to consider. Ultimately, and to the detriment of psychological research, these may be greater influences affecting a player's desire for a game or how they choose to consume media.<br><br></p>
<blockquote><h4>Personality is a thorough comb for refining player bases and understanding player needs.<strong> However, personality data on its own is not the sole answer to successful game design and marketing.</strong> It's just not that simple - and people aren't either.</h4></blockquote>
<p>So in conclusion, these models are more what you call guidelines than actual rules!<br><br></p>

As part of that process, I needed to save a couple of blogs posts that cover university work that I couldn't let slide into the abyss of 404. Even though it's not art related, my academic research dives into game design, marketing, and psychology so I hope you find it an interesting read. As research is abstract and dry at the best of times, I've tried to keep it fun and a light read.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p class="text-center">Xxx_69_PU$$Y_$L4Y3R_69_xxX <em>joined the lobby.</em> <br><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable text-center" style="width: 21.91%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/747/large/852c68e0b1df595dc4276a92c4689503cd59cf5f06ddb9f0ec190a249459eb22.jpg?1560412908" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="442747" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/747/medium/852c68e0b1df595dc4276a92c4689503cd59cf5f06ddb9f0ec190a249459eb22.jpg?1560412908" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p class="text-center"><br></p><h4><strong>Why are some players so vocal about their relationship with your mother during online multiplayer games?</strong></h4><p><br>That's not something this post covers- nor something I can explain. Probably for the best :/</p><p>Nevertheless, If you've ever played a multiplayer game, you've likely been gobsmacked at how some people act and behave in games. You've probably encountered an <em>Xxx_69_PU$$Y_$L4Y3R_69_xxX</em> of the world … or two … or twenty, potentially in the same lobby.</p><p>What interested me about this topic went much deeper than the surface level screeching, slander or ceremonious teabagging. I wanted to know why players were attracted to certain games, genres and art styles to begin with, and if my interest in personality psychology could point me in the right direction.</p><p>It's difficult to know exactly who players are, why they behave in certain ways and what it is they want from a game. There's little to suggest that players <em>actually</em> know what they want aside from "fun" which is both subjective and vague from person to person. There's no tried-and-true guide to understanding audiences and this can be a problem for developers who invest vast amounts of time and money into their work, with no sure-fire model for success. In some cases, player 'wants' aren't necessarily viable (or profitable) development pathways either. </p><p>So as it stands, the picture I've just painted about understanding players is a diorama of WTF, WHO TF, and WHY TF?! Let me shed some light on why I've raised these points. But first- why bother indeed. Why bother considering player "needs" when making games? The conclusion I've come to is this:<br><br></p><blockquote><h4 class="text-center"><em>By understanding players, developers can define what their game really is and who it's really for. This duality has a co-dependence and ultimately shapes the identity of a game. It's game design and game marketing rolled into one. Two sides of the same coin.   </em></h4></blockquote><p><br>As a games technology graduate, I can't share with you any personal experiences within the industry about the challenges of making commercial games. <strong>-</strong> <strong><a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson/blog/0Kw8/the-road-to-rebellion-getting-my-dream-job-in-the-games-industry" target="_blank">[edit- this recently changed wooo]</a>. </strong></p><p>What I can share with you instead, is the six months of academic research I conducted on this topic at Coventry University as part of my BSc Games Technology course. The following blog posts cover my research in <strong>two parts:</strong> <br><br></p><ul>
<li>Part 1 (this post) briefly introduces you to past personality research applied to video games as well as outlining the aims of my own investigation.<br><br>

<strong>Next week's post</strong>, part 2,<strong> </strong>presents the game design and marketing frameworks I created.

</ul><p><strong>Before we get stuck in,</strong> i<em>f you would like to read my <strong>full </strong>research paper, please send me a DM and I'll send you a download link. For n</em>ow, a quick history lesson.<br><em><br></em></p><h3><strong>Playstyle and Personality Research in Games</strong></h3><p>So past research identified that understanding players and differentiating between them was important when designing games. I'll briefly introduce you to four awesome researchers and their work before prefacing my own.</p><h4>
<strong><br>1. Richard Bartle </strong>- 'Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds &amp; Spades' (♡ ♧ ♢ ♤)</h4><p>In 1996, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bartle" target="_blank">Bartle </a>observed play-styles in his now foundational '<em>Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds &amp; Spades</em>' paper. Wanting to know more about those playing his Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) games, he asked high-level players what they wanted from the game. As a result, he observed and laid down four player types, explaining in detail how to balance gameplay and how to create an equilibrium as different players encountered each other in the world. These were outlined as the <em>Killers </em>(♧), <em>Achievers </em>(♢), <em>Socialisers </em>(♡) and the <em>Explorers </em>(♤). Feel free to stare at the included graphs, models and tables for a better overview of the studies.<br><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/446/584/large/bartle.jpg?1560775244" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="446584" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/446/584/medium/bartle.jpg?1560775244" class="img-responsive" /></a><br><strong>NB: </strong><a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=extra+credits+richard+barlte&amp;qs=PF&amp;cvid=739504697e0448cfa91a5fbd95cc1463&amp;refig=c6c357ab4fb94fec943714a7c993aa17&amp;cc=GB&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;plvar=1&amp;ru=%2fsearch%3fq%3dextra%2bcredits%2brichard%2bbarlte%26form%3dEDGTCT%26qs%3dPF%26cvid%3d739504697e0448cfa91a5fbd95cc1463%26refig%3dc6c357ab4fb94fec943714a7c993aa17%26cc%3dGB%26setlang%3den-US%26plvar%3d1&amp;view=detail&amp;mmscn=vwrc&amp;mid=8260EE185B8F3A2A7A678260EE185B8F3A2A7A67&amp;FORM=WRVORC" target="_blank">Extra Credits</a> did a great video on Bartle's player types.</div><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable">Bartle was one of the earliest to break down player behavior in a multiplayer environment. Consequently, his work would become the foundation for modern player research, which often still pays homage to his theories. Bartle- the grandfather of player type research.<br><br>
</div><h4>
<strong>2. Nichole Lazzaro - '</strong>4 Keys to Fun'<strong><br></strong>
</h4><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleLazzaro" target="_blank">Nicole Lazzaro</a> is widely recognized as one of the top women working in video games- and for good reason. In 2003, Lazzaro furthered player research by defining the '<em>4 Keys to Fun</em>'. She conducted extensive observational research through questionnaires, video recordings, and both verbal and non-verbal emotional cues. <em>Hard Fun</em>, <em>Easy Fun</em>, <em>Serious Fun, </em>and <em>People Fun</em> were defined as four categories that players fell into.<br><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 58.45%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/437/517/large/4_keys_poster3.jpg?1560169866" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="437517" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/437/517/medium/4_keys_poster3.jpg?1560169866" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable text-center" style="width: 58.45%;"><br></div><p>The <em>Four Keys</em> was special because it found that players’ attention and preferences were largely attached to the <strong>emotions </strong>that games evoke. It suggested that players weren’t so invested in the design or structure of the game as previously thought, but rather how they felt as they played. Like the rage that engulfs you when you're killed and taunted by a 9-year old who makes helium sound bassy, or the sweet satisfaction of getting them back. No seriously. That's not a joke - that feeling of pleasure at someone else's misfortune is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude" target="_blank">Schadenfreude</a>, and Lazzaro was the first to explore these fascinating moments.<br><br></p><h4>
<strong>3. Nick Yee - </strong>'MMO Motivations of Play'</h4><p>Between 2005-2007, Nick Yee made valuable progress in '<em>Motivations of Play</em>' which statistically analysed what motivated players who engaged with Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Yee’s work can be thought of as an empirical descendant of Bartle’s MUD players. He discovered three overarching motivations of players: <em>Achievement</em>, <em>Socialisation, </em>and <em>Immersion</em>. </p><p><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/447/617/large/from-gamification-through-engagement-to-behavioural-change-martin-ruskov-4-638.jpg?1560844346" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="447617" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/447/617/medium/from-gamification-through-engagement-to-behavioural-change-martin-ruskov-4-638.jpg?1560844346" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br>Yee went onto set up <a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/" target="_blank">Quantic Foundry</a>, a company that conducts market research specifically on gamer motivations. Upon review, Yee had explicitly validated Bartle’s <em>Achiever </em>and <em>Socialiser, </em>with the <em>Killer </em>and <em>Explorer </em>types conflating multiple motivations. These suggest that Bartle had theorised sensibly with his ♡ ♧ ♢ ♤ player types back in the day. Yee’s work was incredibly useful and provided the needed quantitative work that player research had been missing up until this point.<br><br></p><h4>
<strong>4. Chris Bateman - </strong>'BrainHex, Motivations of Play'</h4><p>Finally, I'd like to mention Chris Bateman who has applied personality models to games for over a decade. Chris founded <a href="https://blog.ihobo.com/about-international-hobo.html" target="_blank">ihobo</a>, an international game design consultancies who have worked with the world’s largest publishers, including Atari, EA, Sony, Take-Two, THQ and Ubisoft to mention some. In more recent years, Bateman has been making ground in forming a '<em>Trait Theory of Play</em>'. Quite frankly, he's contributed so much to the field that I can't discuss them all so here's a brief list of what he's studied:</p><ul>
<li>The Myer-Briggs personality types applied to video game players</li>
<li>The difference in playstyles between 'Hardcore' and 'Casual' players</li>
<li>The difference in how female players rated their skills compared to male players</li>
<li>The Difference in multiplayer gamers vs single player gamers</li>
<li>How neurobiology may help to identify the chemical processes behind emotional responses to games</li>
</ul><p><br></p><p> In the latter neurobiological study, Bateman was able to identify potential neurobiological causes behind differences in players and organise them into three categories based on their motivations. These are <strong>Aesthetic</strong>, <strong>Skill </strong>and <strong>Goal</strong>-oriented players which I've tabled below.<br><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 64.83%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/449/125/large/Bateman_and_Nacke_BrainHex_Summary.jpg?1560964407" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="449125" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/449/125/medium/Bateman_and_Nacke_BrainHex_Summary.jpg?1560964407" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br>Bartle, Lazzaro, Yee, and Bateman are just <em>some </em>of the authors in a line of research that extends back nearly twenty-five years. It's a really cool topic and a bit of a rabbit hole. So what do I have to offer to the research Gods?<br><br></p><h4 class="text-center"><strong>Introducing the Player Persona Models</strong></h4><p class="text-center">Initial Empirical Frameworks for Video Game Design and Marketing</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/091/large/All_personas.jpg?1560364157" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="442091" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/442/091/medium/All_personas.jpg?1560364157" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable">
<br>The results summarised in my Player Persona frameworks are based upon the statistical analysis of personality traits of players, as well as:</div><ul>
<li>Game design preferences</li>
<li>Game motivations</li>
<li>Influences on the decision to play or purchase a game</li>
<li>Engagement with game-related activities, content or products.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>[NOTE:]</strong> It should be noted that the instrument that I used to measure personality was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">Five Factor Model</a> (FFM) as it's the most robust and widely accepted model we have so far. The FFM or Big Five model broadly describes personality across five different spectrums:<br><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 48.33%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/450/081/large/the-big-five.jpg?1561050873" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="450081" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/450/081/medium/the-big-five.jpg?1561050873" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p> <br>My research attempted to tackle some of the previous challenges within the research field and aimed to do three main things:<br><br></p><ol>
<li>
<h4>Initiate the use of <strong>personas </strong>in player modelling<strong><br></strong>
</h4>
<br>Personas are an innovation on past player models that do not acknowledge the fluidity of preferences, play-styles, and behaviour. Due to the dynamic nature of these aspects, it's difficult to typify a selection of players. In this context, personas are understood to be <em>representations</em> of players. They should be treated as facets of design and marketing. Real life players are far more complicated and diverse and don't accurately fit into a single 'type' or 'group'.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Provide <strong>empirical, statistical results </strong>for the connection between personality traits with game design and marketing factors.</h4>
<br>The field of player modelling is largely theoretical- that's not to devalue it in any sense. To further the foundational work of the aforementioned Bartle, Lazzaro and Bateman means refining and replicating their work through rigorous statistical analysis.<br><br><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 32.56%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/450/091/large/14608107_1180665285312703_1558693314_n.jpg?1561051177" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="450091" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/450/091/medium/14608107_1180665285312703_1558693314_n.jpg?1561051177" class="img-responsive" /></a></div>
<br>This makes them a 'safer' (or at least a more scientifically reliable) bet at understanding players. Only then would it be potentially viable to use in real-world development processes.<br><br>Further research of personality applied to game design, and particularly in the newer field of game marketing, could yield interesting results. Whether these player "types" are supported a larger scale or not, this is still reliable, user-centred data that just doesn't exist yet. As Chris Bateman put it when I got in touch:<br><br><blockquote><h4>"The question for me is: do we have good tools for talking about a subject? That's what's important to me in personality modelling and player modelling, not whether typings are robust enough to hold up in a wider context."</h4></blockquote>
<p>The results from the Player Persona frameworks investigation were based on 50 players of a similar demographic. Despite a relatively small participant pool, the amount of qualitative AND quantitative data was in-depth and it was intriguing to see distinct patterns in player traits and preferences emerge.<br><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Promote a discussion around <strong>player psychology</strong>, the <strong>potential synergy between design and marketing processes</strong> and assess the <strong>effectiveness of game-related products </strong>according to consumer engagement.</h4>
<strong><br></strong>Should game marketers look into how personality affects consumer behaviour? Does a game's design have an effect on how the game is marketed? Can tailored content marketing generate further game revenue?<br><br>You can't call a period of two weeks a fortnight anymore without conjuring mental images of flossing emotes. (smh)<br><br>In a world where attention can be just as valuable as units shifted, pro-activity outside of the core game experience with tailored content may retain players for longer, or even engage with people who wouldn't usually pick up a game. Targeting not just core players but article readers, box-set collectors, eSports fans, industry professionals, podcast audiences or social influencers with the right content on suitable platforms may provide value beyond the original product.<br><br><div class="media-asset-container media-image"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/443/205/large/squx-stream-670x335.jpg?1560452490" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="443205" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/443/205/medium/squx-stream-670x335.jpg?1560452490" class="img-responsive" /></a></div>
<br>Twitch is a popular streaming website for gamers. Can game marketers leverage the platform to rocket-power games to stardom? CS:GO, DotA, LoL, Rocket League and Fortnite are just a handful of games that have shaped what online streaming looks like today and have been shaped themselves by the constant online spotlight. It could be argued online influencers herd specific audiences to a game, whether the game was designed with those people in mind or not.<br><br>Virality is unpredictable but it's undeniable how powerful social evangelism and word-of-mouth can elevate a game to new heights. Whether it's bringing more readers to a post-mortem article, hooking Twitch viewers in behind-the-scene livestreams from the studio or hard sales through Facebook ads on launch day...<br><strong><br></strong>
</li>

<em>02/05/19 - Kieran Goodson - 12 min read</em><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/803/large/RoadToRebellion.jpg?1556823721" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413803" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/803/medium/RoadToRebellion.jpg?1556823721" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>The story begins roughly 11 months ago - fitting because there are eleven parts to this story. It's June 2018, my dissertation deadline was in the rear view mirror and my uni course had come to an end. It was time to reflect on my three years on the BSc Games Tech course and think about which route down the game dev rabbit hole I wished to dive. </p><h4><strong>1. Portfolios in the Playground</strong></h4><p>Thoroughly enjoying the art and design modules during my degree, I knew that was the direction I wanted to take my career in. With my <a href="http://www.kierangoodson.com/research" target="_blank">game design dissertation</a> still in the back of my mind, I began to research what it would take to get into the industry at the junior level.</p><blockquote><h4>I read the same thing over and over again. The same narrative on every article, forum and website I visited. Portfolio. Portfolio. Portfolio. It is king.</h4></blockquote><p>I had a "portfolio" at the time with all my latest work which the course had encouraged us to maintain. A well-known studio had visited uni earlier in 2018 to do interviews, looking to bring on board a Junior Programmer. This was a brilliant opportunity to talk face-to-face with industry devs. Programming? Not for me. But I went in with a good attitude and explained how I could be of value as a Junior Designer instead. </p><p><em>"Kieran is friendly and personable and can talk about games, but I’m not really able to judge his ability as a game designer".</em> </p><p>I learned two things that day- firstly my "portfolio" wasn't up to scratch. More importantly, you can't take feedback and critique personally. <strong>It was spot on. </strong></p><blockquote><h4>My "portfolio" showed off my university work, but it wasn't a cohesive, targeted or professional-looking website of work to show I had what it took to contribute to a studio.</h4></blockquote><h4><strong>2. Destined to design?</strong></h4><p>With that portfolio feedback in mind, when uni was over I took a well-reviewed course on Udemy. It contained good advice about building a level design portfolio... but I never finished because I got busy getting on with it. That was a micro-lesson in itself. Tutorials are good but nothing like the learning experience of just getting on with it and failing along the way. I found it to be faster.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 45.18%;"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/802/large/udemy-course.jpg?1556823689" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413802" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/802/medium/udemy-course.jpg?1556823689" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><blockquote><h4>Pick your top 5 studios you'd like to work for and write down what kind of games they make. Then, tailor your portfolio to show off the same kind of work.</h4></blockquote><p>A free WordPress account with a blog post format wasn't cutting it. I upped my game in July, bought myself a domain and put the hours in designing a <a href="http://www.kierangoodson.com" target="_blank"><em>fancy website</em></a>. Rule number 1: no fancy websites! (More on this topic later) </p><h4><strong>3. Oh, it's pronounced 'Environment Art'</strong></h4><p>By August 2018, I'd moved back home ready to add some fresh, post-grad work to my new website. We'd used Unity at uni but something about Unreal just came naturally to me. The good UI; the sculpting and foliage tools; the awesome lighting and atmospherics; the visual programming for animations and shaders. I was happy that I found myself finally clicking with a game engine and suddenly feeling very passionate about games again. However...</p><p>... my first level design was a failure.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9vLYa" target="_blank"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/805/large/21x9_aspect_with_cinelines.jpg?1556824351" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413805" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/805/medium/21x9_aspect_with_cinelines.jpg?1556824351" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>Level design is about blocking out a map, understanding gameplay flow and plotting events. It was a failure because I was just playing with the tools inside Unreal creating a fictitious scene from imagination. That something turned out to be my <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9vLYa" target="_blank">Savanna piece</a>.</p><blockquote><h4>It dawned on me that I wasn't designing game levels- I was creating game environments. But I loved it, so I never looked back.</h4></blockquote><h4><strong>4. The Rabbit Hole of Environment Art</strong></h4><p>I never imagined myself wanting to become an artist. I'd always enjoyed photography and film and thrived in the creative modules at university.</p><p>By September, I'd added my first environment to my portfolio and I no longer saw myself as a budding designer. I dug deeper into what Environment Art involved. It was a rabbit hole of information, tutorials and new software that I still believe I'm digging my way through.</p><blockquote><h4>It was an enlightening few months as I discovered industry quality work, talked to industry figures and undertook the industry pipeline</h4></blockquote><p>Learning where to learn was the most interesting part of the process. To pay or not to pay, that was the question. I'd just finished uni and was now applying 0% of my further education to my career path with a good amount of debt. Well, the answer I found was exploring a bit of both.</p><p>I strongly recommend YouTube, Polycount, 80 Level and Discord communities as brilliant free resources. You'll find many industry artists also offer quality content through Gumroad and ArtStation for very reasonable prices (usually between £0-£20) considering their skills and years of experience. Individuals such as Daniel Thiger (pictured below), Josh Lynch and Jonas Ronnegard of some of my personal favourites for Substance Designer. A quick browse of the ArtStation storefront will clue you in more about what's available.  </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" href="https://www.artstation.com/dete" target="_blank"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/807/large/ArtStation-Daniel-Thiger.jpg?1556824470" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413807" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/807/medium/ArtStation-Daniel-Thiger.jpg?1556824470" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>At the higher end of the scale, and aimed at intermediate artists, places such as Flipped Normals, Gnomon, CGMA, The Mentor Coalition, Learn Squared and Game Art Institute seem like worthy places to invest in premium online education.</p><p>Putting the university vs online education to one side, regardless of your background, these are great places to start and further your environment art experience.</p><h4><strong>5. Get up again!</strong></h4><p>Over the last eleven months, I've applied to many, many, many positions. I learned with each setback how to write tailored cover letters, how to condense my CV and how to avoid pet-peeves recruiters have when it comes to portfolios. And believe me, you'll need some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCkmIyC6v00" target="_blank">Tubthumping</a> in your life to keep you going through application rounds.</p><p><strong>(NB:</strong> I'll be writing a dedicated article soon covering this topic but for now, Andy Dowley's "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-reasons-why-i-might-loathe-your-cv-andy-dowley/" target="_blank">Why I might loathe your CV</a>" and "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/juniors-you-andy-dowley/" target="_blank">JUNIORS, this is for you</a>" are MUST reads!<strong>)</strong></p><p>Four months after uni, I became more picky about which jobs I applied for. Living rent and responsibility-free, that didn't go down amazingly with the parents. "Three years of peace and quiet and now you come back with this" mocked my parents. "Graduate bum" I was nicknamed by the girlfriend. Fair enough I thought.</p><p>But deep down I knew I wanted to be an environment artist so it made no sense continuing to applying for QA or intern designer roles- the latter, no longer a door into the industry I had read. I had a strong suspicion that if I had got a job like these, I'd be in that role for, best-case-scenario, a whole year. It seemed I'd be breaking into the industry faster if I doubled-down and persisted with building my new portfolio. So that's what I did.</p><h4><strong>6. Addicted to Substances</strong></h4><p>By October 2018, I'd discovered Allegorithmic's Substance suite for authoring textures and materials. I kept seeing the acronym 'PBR' and soon realised it was the industry-standard texturing method. I bought the book on '<a href="https://www.allegorithmic.com/pbr-guide" target="_blank">Physically Based Rendering</a>' and began to understand what made materials look realistic and physically accurate. Wes McDermott's <a href="https://academy.allegorithmic.com/" target="_blank">Substance Academy</a> tutorials were brilliant.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bow49BJhR5w/" target="_blank"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/808/large/PBR_guide.jpg?1556824802" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413808" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/808/medium/PBR_guide.jpg?1556824802" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>I can only describe Substance Painter as the Photoshop for 3D models - quite fitting considering Adobe's recent acquisition of Algorithmic. After getting used to putting together material shaders in the Unreal Engine, the node-based setup in Substance Designer was pleasantly familiar. The first time I used them both they blew my mind. We weren't exposed to these techniques at uni.</p><p>My new art portfolio began to show I had some knowledge of environment art. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/809/large/1920x823_21x9_Bannered_Forest_Moss.jpg?1556824889" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413809" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/809/medium/1920x823_21x9_Bannered_Forest_Moss.jpg?1556824889" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><h4><strong>7. ArtStation</strong></h4><p>I'll preface this section by saying <strong>good to see you here on the platform. </strong></p><p>Remember how I'd made myself a fancy website from <strong>#2</strong>? At the time it had a huge splash screen with hover animations and all sorts of bells and whistles. I made the decision to transfer my portfolio over to ArtStation for several reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Loading times</strong></li></ul><p>There's nothing worse than a slow site. Art leads have a limited amount of time and will make quick decisions about your fitting for the role. By the time they've loaded your fancy portfolio, even if it's solid work, they're already frustrated. This isn't the mindset you want people to be in when viewing you, your work and your brand. ArtStation eradicates this issue provided image resolutions are reasonable.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson" target="_blank"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/810/large/ArtStat.jpg?1556825069" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413810" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/810/medium/ArtStat.jpg?1556825069" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Simple and functional</strong></li></ul><p>ArtStation is clean and simple. You know when you click on a button, it'll link you to the right place. When building your own website, it's easy to get excited with eccentric design and forget about functionality. You don't want to accidentally lead decision-makers down the 404 road. Don't leave that to chance because it will be a dealbreaker.</p><ul><li><strong>Popular</strong></li></ul><p>The added bonus of having an ArtStation portfolio is that you have industry eyes on your work all the time. More eyes = more opportunity for you to be spotted. Familiarity is safety. Industry professionals know ArtStation inside and out so why take the market outside of its comfort zone if you can help it?</p><p>Tim Simpson <a href="https://www.polygon-academy.com/why-your-portfolio-needs-to-be-on-artstation/" target="_blank">discusses in further detail why your portfolio needs to be on ArtStation.</a></p><h4><strong>8. Dinusty</strong></h4><p>By November, YouTube was my best friend. With several more applications out the door and several more coming back as "this position has been filled", I once again decided my portfolio wasn't good enough yet.</p><p>I discovered a series of environment art portfolio reviews by Jeremy Estrelado, a Senior Environment Artist from Ubisoft Massive.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/818/large/Din.jpg?1556825548" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413818" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/818/medium/Din.jpg?1556825548" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><blockquote><h4>Getting insight into how a senior artist critiques artwork is invaluable. It's critical to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your work if you're to successfully market yourself to recruiters and studios.</h4></blockquote><p>I joined the <a href="https://www.dinustyempire.com/" target="_blank">Dinusty</a> discord on a whim as I liked the videos he was putting out. I stayed because it felt like home. </p><p>The discord is a waterhole for industry environment artists, budding game art students and indie developers. Need critiques? Unparalleled quality and quantity quickly<em>! </em>Got a technical issue? No problem. Need a tutorial for something? There's a database and active thread for that. Alongside monthly challenges, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7L1zsVMaVndxgZfjoSK-Zw">brilliant new podcast</a> and Twitch streams twice a week, the community (and it does feel like a community) is something I wish I was a part of during uni. It's great to chat to the people behind the awesome work you see online. </p><h4>
<strong>9. </strong><a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oO9kKz" target="_blank"><strong>'Those Who Mourn'</strong></a>
</h4><p>November comes around and I hadn't yet combined the new skills. I hadn't leveraged the power of quality critiques either. I found an inspiring reference photo for a new environment and the rest was history. ( I won't go into vast amounts of detail as I did that <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/xzBa0O" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/819/large/2._TWM_2019.jpg?1556825730" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413819" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/819/medium/2._TWM_2019.jpg?1556825730" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>I picked up ZBrush, SpeedTree and Marvelous Designer along the way. They're brilliant pieces of software, each tailored to doing one thing incredibly well. My project required organic sculpting, foliage creation and clothing simulation so it made sense to take on the challenge of all three.</p><blockquote><h4>I picked up three new pieces of software and shook them until the things I needed from them fell out. I now have a richer technical skillset but I don’t ever plan on knowing what all the buttons do.</h4></blockquote><p>It was an ambitious project that I nearly gave up on at points but I learned that it's important to take the extra time to finish and polish to industry quality. 'Those Who Mourn' was the sole project that demonstrated to potential employers that I had the core skills of an environment artist:</p><ul>
<li>Fundamental modelling skills</li>
<li>Correct application of PBR materials</li>
<li>Demonstrable XP of a real-time engine</li>
<li>Understanding of composition, colour theory and shape language</li>
<li>Thoughtfulness for overall level design</li>
<li>Proficiency with lighting</li>
</ul><p>The cliche of "quality over quantity" rings very true when it comes to portfolios.</p><h4><strong>10. <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/xzBa0O" target="_blank">80 LEVEL Article</a></strong></h4><p>In December 2018, I was fortunate enough to be emailed by Kirill Tokarev from <a href="https://80.lv/" target="_blank">80 LEVEL</a>. </p><p>He had seen my latest environment on Polycount where I'd asked forum users for feedback on a WIP screenshot. He said it looked solid and asked if I'd be interested in answering a few questions about it for an article. I was. I did.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/820/large/Environment_Design_Breakdown_Banner.jpg?1556825831" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413820" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/820/medium/Environment_Design_Breakdown_Banner.jpg?1556825831" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>I finished in February 2019 and took an entire week to write an extensive breakdown, taking care to show my process and understanding through gifs and paint<strong>-</strong>over screenshots. This was a golden opportunity to show the industry what I could do and what I was about. At the start of March, Kirill and I released my article and work on the same day. It made a bit of a splash and brought my work to the attention of thousands of industry eyes.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable" style="width: 51.28%;"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/821/large/Portfolio_spike.jpg?1556825853" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="413821" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/413/821/medium/Portfolio_spike.jpg?1556825853" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>The feeling of being on the map felt good and it was encouraging to receive so many lovely comments from industry pros.</p><h4><strong>11. Personal projects. Round of applications. Rinse and repeat.</strong></h4><p>By March 2019, it had been ten months of on-off applications. Ten months of mostly radio silence; ten months of "this position has been filled" or "looking for someone with more experience". I'd had a phone interview with a tech company and had been contacted on <a href="https://twitter.com/atkaygee" target="_blank">Twitter </a>to have an art test with a smaller studio but they'd both fallen through too. </p><p>After releasing <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oO9kKz" target="_blank">'Those Who Mourn'</a>, it was like a switch had been flicked.</p><p>In the first week of April, I had three in-studio interviews lined up on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at various studios across the country.</p><blockquote><h4><em>'Those Who Mourn' represents three months, three new pieces of software and three job interviews as a result</em></h4></blockquote><p>I'd had a Skype interview a couple weeks prior with one. This was a really nice induction into the casual interview style. It was great to finally meet face-to-face and see real studios in action. One of the leads said he discovered my work through my 80 LEVEL article and made the move to get me on-call. That comment was repeated throughout all three interviews which was very humbling.</p><p>By the end of the following week, I had two job offers and an art test on the table. I'd also been offered remote freelancing work on a couple of indie projects which was really cool. It was really nice to have options, especially after 11 months of nothingness. In the end, I selected the right studio for me.</p><p>I start my game dev debut as Junior Environment Artist at Rebellion Oxford in June. <br><br><em><a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson" target="_blank"><em>Kieran Goodson</em></a><em> -  Junior Environment Artist at Rebellion</em><em> | <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kierangoodson" target="_blank">Portfolio </a>| <a href="https://www.twitter.com/atkaygee/" target="_blank">Twitter </a>| <a href="https://www.instagram.com/atkaygee/" target="_blank">Instagram </a>| <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kierangoodson/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></em></em></p>]]>
