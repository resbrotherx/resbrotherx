      <title>Witherhoard Concept Art by Eric Pfeiffer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Concept art for the Witherhoard exotic in D2 Season of Arrivals.</p>

<p>The Witherhoard is the Drifter's passion project, a blend of scavenged parts, and intricate metalworking. I imagined the Drifter tinkering away at this slowly over many years trying to find the perfect balance to weaponize Taken Blights.</p>

<p>Taken Energy is seemingly conscious and does not want to be contained. The weapon frame does the job well enough but only by releasing small amounts of Taken Energy through the pressure valve which creates a stand-in for the iron sights. Once fired, the weapon bursts open and finally releases its grip on the Taken Blight.</p>

<p>In-game model by Elliot Sharp.

        <![CDATA[<p>St XIV themed Weapon designs for Season of the Dawn in Destiny 2.</p>

<p>The assignment was simple: to design a new set of weapons based off of St XIV's original weapon, the Perfect Paradox, which was designed by the incredible Patrick Bloom. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.artstation.com/patrickbloom">https://www.artstation.com/patrickbloom</a></p>

<p>The hardsurface team at Bungie did a phenomenal job creating these.

      <title>The Lantern of Osiris by Eric Pfeiffer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>There was an opportunity with the introduction of artifacts in Destiny 2 that could give the players a device that would represent their journey through the narrative of that season. Having an object the players would continually revisit and build upon meant that it should be changing with them as they progressed and would hopefully encapsulate the overarching narrative of that season.  In Season of Dawn, we brought back Osiris, a character the players know as the hyper-intelligent, time-traveling scientist who helps us rescue St XIV from his death in the past.  The Lantern is an invention of Osiris, a device used to hone in on the correct frequencies of time. Similar to using a tuning fork to find the right note, the user would cycle through the various runes between consonant and dissonant wavelengths until they were in tune with the correct frequency, unlocking the doorway into that dimension.</p>]]>

      <title>Destiny 2 Bombardiers Exotic by Eric Pfeiffer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This hunter exotic was one of my first assignments at Bungie. Inspired by the Japanese gods of weather, Raijin and Fujin. Raijin, the god of thunder, lightning and storms and Fujin, the god of wind. I felt the lore behind these deities matched well with the perk mechanic of dodging and leaving behind an explosive. 
<br />A burst of wind followed by a clap of thunder.
<br />I had this idea of hunters playing taiko drums, similar to Raijin's, as a way to warn other troops and it created an interesting narrative for me to work from. I imagined them scouting ahead of the group and sounding off their drums when they were ambushed. Warlocks, watching from afar, halting when they hear the drums, then witness the flash as Fallen Dregs fly outwardly through the air.
<br />Of course, in-game, it's just a great way to deal with a Titan's shoulder charge. ￼</p>]]>

      <title>Dropship Oculus Medium Test by Eric Pfeiffer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I recently dove into VR sculpting and I have to say, it's pretty incredible. This is my first test attempting hard surface design using Oculus Medium. Certainly not perfect but it's a very fast way to get an idea down or build a rough model for reference.  Going to try Gravity Sketch next which seems more ideal for industrial or hard surface design but I was really surprised at how fast I could work and with a surprising amount of detail using Medium. </p>]]>

      <title>EGO, SELF DISCIPLINE AND FEAR by Eric Pfeiffer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Ego, self discipline and fear. How to take control of your mistakes and determine the outcome of your journey.]]>
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>I originally wrote this article 4 years ago on my old blog which I no longer use. It still stands today and admittedly, I still have a hard time taking my own advice. For anyone who follows my work, I'm posting this here in case it may help you in some small way.</p><p>Relinquish your fear, establish self discipline and control your ego. This is the simplest advice I can give to any person aspiring to reach personal goals.</p><p>I’m writing this not only for the students and aspiring artists that follow my work but also in hopes of solidifying some personal ideologies thus, hopefully, keeping myself in check. I am not always adept at taking my own advice. I will do my best to keep this straightforward and to the point.</p><p>It is dangerous to define yourself <em>solely</em> as your ultimate goal. If you want to be an artist than you must be much more than just that. If you define yourself solely as your ultimate goal, say an illustrator, then you are laying a thin and weak foundation that will not withstand the slightest amount of failure. Since there is no progression without failure the foundation of one’s true self must be complex enough to withstand such force. Welcome failure and do not fear it – just prepare for it.</p><p>Be skilled at more than just one thing. Do not be <em>just </em>be an artist or say to yourself “But it’s all I’m good at,” or “It’s all I know,” this will not garner sympathy. Sympathy will do nothing for you so do not go searching for it. You must be a whole person, well-rounded with experiences. You must be <em>complex</em>. When creating anything you must have a wealth of experiences and original ideas to pull from. The personal ideologies that you hold are the very building blocks of which you use to create your work so if you feel you have none then ask yourself this: How can I expect to create anything meaningful if I have no experiences, no opinions or original ideas? Your life is what you have to work with so add to it as much as possible. You need fuel for the fire.</p><p>Do not become a prisoner of your ego and allow yourself to believe that you are the best or worst at anything. Your ego tries to protect you from what will hurt you and so it may lie to you. It will cause you to become disillusioned. When it comes to meeting a challenge, if left unchecked, your ego will become your worst enemy. Your ego will take your mind to distracting places, “Who is watching?” “What will they think?” “I’m no good at this,” etc. But chances are that when you decided to become an artist for a living you said to yourself, “Who cares what they think! I got this!” So when it comes to meeting a challenge and taking risks why would you suddenly decide to care? Control your ego and take chances. You will grow because of it.</p><p>Get to know yourself, be honest and unafraid. Experience yourself for who you truly are. Allow yourself to be vulnerable and exposed. A seed will not grow under a stone. Do not shelter yourself. Do not hate or pity yourself when you fail. You have a responsibility to yourself to be happy. You have no one else to blame for your attitude and well-being so do not romanticize the struggles of being an artist. Stand by the decision you made to be what you are or get up and change. No one will blame you for changing your mind nor sympathize you for staying unhappy.</p><p>This industry rewards those who are original and pays no attention to those who are not so comparing yourself to other artists is completely pointless. It is so easy to spend all your time on the internet gawking over what others are doing but it will get you nowhere. Again, I am not always adept at taking my own advice and I am guilty of this as well. But this is not a race. There is no competition. We all have great things ahead of us so just stay focused, get up early, gather what you can from life, explore, experiment and evolve. Inspiration does not come from envy – it comes from experience.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image" style="width: 40.96%;"><br></div><p><br></p><p><br></p>]]>

      <title>Apophis Character Design by Eric Pfeiffer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A character concept I've been putting together as a design exercise.
<br />For these personal design projects I find it very helpful to take a game that you enjoy, research it's player base, how they play, what they wish they had in the game and what they wish they could change, then analyze the different personality types and their reasoning behind their tastes and design something to fill that niche. I found it interesting how many players prefer to play solo even in social games that are meant to be played online with others. I took the idea of implementing an NPC that can give those lone wolf players more freedom but at a steep risk.</p>]]>

      <title>Mask of Hidden Agendas Concept by Eric Pfeiffer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>"Mask of Hidden Agendas" concept. Part of a character concept I'm putting together based on the idea of an NPC character that operates as a gun for hire but is unpredictable in nature. An ancient machine that wants to be human but continually fights its AI instinct to be ultimately self serving.  This is the animation idea I had of what happens when the NPC is activated by the player along with the some facial animations of its face plates swapping out.  My goal is to put together a full character concept in the next week and then implement it into a full illustration so more to come! This is just the initial phase.</p>]]>

      <title>Arcadia Comic Cover by Eric Pfeiffer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Cover I did for a comic series I illustrated in 2015 called "Arcadia," written by Alex Paknadel and published by Boom Studios.

While this year I'm mainly focusing on building my concept art portfolio and developing my own IP, I have signed on for a few other comic projects so I'll be sure and post work from them as well.</p>]]>
