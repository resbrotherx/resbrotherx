      <title>80's Vending Machine by Jonjo Hemmens</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A 80's style vending machine sat around the corner from a 7/11. I made this prop to compliment the prop I did late last year, the 80's fridge.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time studying and re-creating confectionery from the 1980's to better understand graphic design of the time. Some are skewed, some are real, some are completely new.</p>

<p>I decided to present the vending machine with a small diorama to show how the machine sits in a scene made with Megascans. Although it's not exactly "photo-real" I feel like it holds up pretty well against real world scan data.</p>

<p>Big thanks to Kieran Goodson, Rick Greeve, Ben Keeling, and the 3DFT community for their feedback on texturing and presentation throughout, it was massively helpful. </p>

<p>I should be releasing the cans, sweets and crisps as free assets on my marketplace over the next few weeks. </p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Earlier in the year I was fortunate enough to work alongside the talented artists at NVidia on their Marbles RTX Demo. My focus on these assets was primarily texturing, but also a little bit of UV unpacking and mesh clean up. I want to extend a massive thanks to both Gavrill Klimov and to Jacob Norris, as well as all the other incredible artists who worked on this project. Please check out the final result at the bottom of the post</p>

      <title>Art Graveyard: 01 by Jonjo Hemmens</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[]]>

      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>Hey all, I hope you're all managing okay with the quarantine, and keeping yourselves busy with art, gaming, movies, and all that good stuff.</p><p>Since I started my full-time job at Creative Assembly, I've made a big effort to keep doing personal artwork. During this time, I've given up on a lot of projects for a variety of reasons, but mainly because they're just not fun to come back to at the end of a work day. Up until my first job I had taken almost every project to completion, and I've found it to be uncomfortable to leave projects unfinished. When I finished my recent props or finished freelance work, I kept thinking about returning to these large projects. Even though I had stopped working on them for a good reason, I felt compelled to go back just out of habit.</p><p>All these unfinished projects have been a serious distraction that took focus away from learning, and my more meaningful projects. So I've decided just to dump all my dead projects on my Artstation blog in a big art graveyard so I no longer have to consider working on them. They're all at various stages of completeness, and also various stages of shit-ness. I doubt this will be my last Art Graveyard either, so look forward to more crap next year!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - <em>I'm posting unfinished kinda shit work here so I can move onto new stuff</em></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/719/large/syl2.jpg?1588881726" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563719" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/719/medium/syl2.jpg?1588881726" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p>This was a scene I was working on based of a concept by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/GEmzW">Sylvain Sarrailh</a>. Had fun blocking out, experimenting with lighting. Ended up doing a couple of props, then just focusing on just the TV.</p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/713/large/coffee_01.jpg?1588881629" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563713" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/713/medium/coffee_01.jpg?1588881629" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><div class="media-asset-container"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/745/large/coffee_03.jpg?1588884853" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563745" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/745/medium/coffee_03.jpg?1588884853" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>A coffee machine I was making for my 80's props collection. Texturing was 60/70 percent done, lots needed reworking and tweaking. Presentation and lighting was tough and my painters files caused tonnes of crashing so I decided to just shelve it.</p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/715/large/props_01.jpg?1588881660" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563715" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/715/medium/props_01.jpg?1588881660" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p>Some of the props I was working on for these scenes. Again, various levels of shit-ness. Most are half finished / scene clutter.</p><p><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/718/large/dww.jpg?1588881703" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563718" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/718/medium/dww.jpg?1588881703" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p>  A tunnel for a heist scene I was working on. Some more shots of this below.</p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/727/large/awdawd_(1).jpg?1588881755" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563727" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/727/medium/awdawd_(1).jpg?1588881755" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/725/large/11.jpg?1588881753" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563725" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/725/medium/11.jpg?1588881753" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/724/large/awdawd.jpg?1588881751" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563724" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/724/medium/awdawd.jpg?1588881751" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/723/large/awdawd_(4).jpg?1588881748" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563723" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/723/medium/awdawd_(4).jpg?1588881748" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p>This was all one big scene and proved to be a bit too large considering my schedule and beyond the blocking out phase there's as much room for learning as I would have liked for a project this large. So I took the TV, fridge, and Vending machine, and focused on making those really high quality instead. </p><p><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/746/large/screenshot002.jpg?1588884853" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563746" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/746/medium/screenshot002.jpg?1588884853" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/747/large/screenshot012.jpg?1588884856" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="563747" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/563/747/medium/screenshot012.jpg?1588884856" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>A couple of pallet jacks I got about 40 percent of the texture work done on. Wanted to have a cleaner one, and a more pristine one.

        <![CDATA[<h4>I had a great chat with Alex about my texturing process, the debate on megascans and their value, seperating yourself from your art work, and where our futures are hopefully going to take us. Despite the tech issues, it was a great talk, hope to be back on the podcast soon!</h4><h4>Take a listen on Youtube, and check out Alex's portfolio on Artstation. He recently became a member of staff, so give him some love!<br><br>

      <title>80's Refrigerator  by Jonjo Hemmens</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A refrigerator that's been sat in the break room of an old loading bay for a few years. This prop is part of a larger scene I'm working on, more information about it here -<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://polycount.com/discussion/215810/wip-ue4-loading-bay-heist#latest">https://polycount.com/discussion/215810/wip-ue4-loading-bay-heist#latest</a></p>

<p>The notices and cobwebs are on their own atlas as they'll be used in many place around the scene. I've been working on this prop on and off for a couple of weeks, just trying to get the materials feeling right. The asset is a bit high poly, but for most game uses you could cut the stuff from the back including the wires. </p>

<p>Thanks to Derk Elshof for help with working out the normals on the paper</p>

<p>And also a thanks to Lea Kronenberger for her Merlins cave breakdown, helped me work out how to do the cobwebs!</p>

      <title>Old TV by Jonjo Hemmens</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>An old beat-up CRT TV that has seen better days. This is a prop I've been working on for a couple of weeks now to learn better texturing and presentation techniques. I've got a much better understanding of alphas, decals, materials, and the importance of mixing procedurals with manual painting. The geometry isn't the cleanest, some bad bevels and some edges that could be collapsed, but since this was texturing practice, I didn't spend as much time cleaning up lowpoly. The wire is also a bit overkill at 1806 tris, could be halved quite easily. Modelled in Maya, textured in Substance Painter, and rendered in Marmoset. Big thanks to Kieran Goodson and Alex Beddows for giving me feedback on this piece, it really helped push it further!

      <title>Light the Path by Jonjo Hemmens</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The final throes of a defeated civilisation. After a lengthy siege, a viking warband finally break into the neighbouring kingdom. A harsh winter falls upon the land, and a path has been lit to guide those left in this bleak wasteland into more fertile lands.  </p>

<p>Special thanks to Dom Marriott <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.artstation.com/domm">https://www.artstation.com/domm</a> , the lovely people at the DiNusty Empire, and everyone who gave support and feedback on Polycount. Without you, I would've given up on this piece months ago. </p>

<p>This project took about 5 or so months. All of the assets seen were created by me, apart from 2 boy and his kite demo rocks, a rock from quixel, GOOD SKY, and the snow particles. As for learning resources, I used Jacob Norris' Snow Tutorial and Tyler Smiths Cloud Tutorial. There's also some Skyrim music and free sound fx in the cinematic video that I didn't make. Here's my polycount thread if you're interested <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://polycount.com/discussion/211004/wip-ue4-snow-siege/p1">https://polycount.com/discussion/211004/wip-ue4-snow-siege/p1</a></p>]]>

      <title>National Bank - Art Test by Jonjo Hemmens</title>

      <title>Invasion - Blocking out by Jonjo Hemmens</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Environment Art]]>
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>Thought I'd write a quick blog post about my new environment piece. I've been trying a load of new stuff with this project, and there's so much fun stuff to come. <strong>The project is still in it's early block out stages! </strong><strong>This post will just be about my progress so far.</strong></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/407/026/large/4.jpg?1553457040" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="407026" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/407/026/medium/4.jpg?1553457040" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>I started with the desire to learn more about landscape materials and terrain tools in UE4. I started with the snow ground tutorial from Jacob Norris, and decided to create a whole scene with that knowledge as a foundation. Whilst searching for references for the project, I came across Sergey Zabelin's "Castle in a snowy forest" (<a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/3w1EJ">https://www.artstation.com/artwork/3w1EJ</a> ) which really inspired me. I decided to start with his concept as a foundation, and work from there.</p><p>The mountains were the most important part of this scene, so I worked on those first. Very recently, Quadspinner (creators of geoglpyh for Worldmachine 2) put out their own terrain modeller, <a href="https://quadspinner.com/gaea/">Gaea</a>. The tool takes a lot of great tools from Geoglpyh and Worldmachine as well as adding some new stuff. It's got a lovely UI and rarely lags. It's pretty new so there's LOTS of bugs, beware if you want to use it in production! The tool is free with a 1k texture map limit, but to get around this, I exported the high poly mesh mountain to bake onto a plane for texturing in Substance Designer. The normal map can be used to generate height, curvature and AO info with little effort and no cost :) </p><p>Disclaimer - Rocks in the scenes (and the thick curvy tree) are scans from Quixel and the Epic Games Boy and his Kite demo that I've run through my master material. Unlike my other projects, I've decided to use some assets that I haven't mostly authored so I can put larger scale scenes together a bit quicker. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/407/009/large/2.jpg?1553455057" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="407009" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/407/009/medium/2.jpg?1553455057" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>I decided that I wanted to create a large castle on top of the mountain, with a treacherous climb to reach it's entrance. I also wanted to create a large border wall stretching across the mountains to give a reason for the position and attack of the castle. Viking style invaders trying to break into the land of a medieval French style kingdom. </p><p>The siege camp is in its earliest blockout phase. I'm working out where I want to place tents, fortifications, wagons, equipment, etc. in a realistic manner. More research into this area is necessary before moving forward I think. For the tents and flags, I plan on utilising some of the techniques show by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kteper">Krzysztof Teper</a> in his Korath scene to get a nice wind blowing the fabric.</p><p> I used a bridge and a small river as a division between the two sides. This helped seperate the scene into two digestible areas; the siege camp and the castle.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/407/010/large/3.jpg?1553455058" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="407010" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/407/010/medium/3.jpg?1553455058" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>The castle is still in a really early blockout phase, and I will need to start working out how I want to make a kit out of the pieces. So far I have been experimenting with splines, but I've been struggling to create walls on the Z Axis without the meshes freaking out, so more research needs to be done there I think. I will also need to add significant destruction and decay to these areas, as I want the siege to have been successful, destroying significant parts of the castle in the process.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/407/025/large/1.jpg?1553457026" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="407025" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/407/025/medium/1.jpg?1553457026" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>That's about it so far. Still so much to block out and iterate on! Let me know what you think, or if you have any questions about the scene so far don't hesitate to ask. </p><p>Cheers for reading!</p>]]>

      <title>Project Snow - Master Material Stuff by Jonjo Hemmens</title>
      <description>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Project Snow - Master Material Stuff</strong></p><p>Thought I'd show some early work on my new environment piece. As I've avoided doing proper organic scenes, I decided to jump in and do something I'd never tried before.</p><p>I decided to do a full exterior scene based with a large amount of variety. So far, I've been working on my landscape material, blocking out, master materials, as well as some large mountains I put together using the just released Gaea. The master material has been the most interesting part of the project so far. After seeing the landscape and level kit of Star Wars: Battlefront, I wanted to try create something similiar in Unreal. I wanted to create a versatile kit that minimised on the amount of meshes I had to make to give the scene enough variety. With university studies coming to a close, every bit of time saved with this kit is super valuable. </p><p><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/393/246/large/2.jpg?1551995725" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="393246" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/393/246/medium/2.jpg?1551995725" class="img-responsive" /></a></p><p>I've used quixel props here to demonstrate the master material. </p><p><br></p><p>Here's some of the functionality of the master material;</p><p>The material applies snow to the top of assets through a material layer blend. Also includes vertex painting functionality for any areas you do/don't want snow. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/393/248/original/Gif4.gif?1551995930" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="393248" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/393/248/original/Gif4.gif?1551995930" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>The material also blends the meshes into the landscape. For this effect, there's a mix of a distance field blend (link to the resource at the bottom) which grabs to world position and the distance to the nearest surface and blends the landscape snow where it intersects with another object. </p><p>There's also use of a subtle pixel depth offset just to blue the harsh edge between the props and the landscape. </p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/393/239/original/Gif3.gif?1551994962" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="393239" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/393/239/original/Gif3.gif?1551994962" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>The shader is a little expensive with all the bells and whistles applied, but it really help sells the look I want. I binged a lot of tutorials to put this one together. Here's a nice list of resources if you'd like to put something similiar together for your own projects.</p><p> The material also hosts support for all the standard hueshifts, detail mapping, masked albedo textures, optional emissive values, etc.</p><p>Anyway, more work on this project to come (possibly in blog form, or not, we'll see).</p><p><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/393/271/large/Image1.jpg?1551996750" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="393271" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/393/271/medium/Image1.jpg?1551996750" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p>Resources - </p><p><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/BVVFy">https://gumroad.com/l/BVVFy</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDluA1f5gzw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDluA1f5gzw</a></p><p><br></p>]]>

<p>Will is a 19 year old student, living at home while he continues his studies. This is his room.</p>

<p>With this project, I wanted to get better at creating high quality props, and improve my understanding of lighting. This project took about 10 weeks to complete. I drew a lot of inspirations from my friends at Uni and family members.</p>

<p>Big thanks to my friends and to all those on Polycount who helped give me feedback, pushing this piece much further.</p>

        <![CDATA[A mech hangar using tiling trim techniques]]>
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>Hey people, felt like doing a bit of a blog post on something I've been working on, in spare time over the past few months. </p><p>The project is a hangar to house to large mech (based on KaranaK's amazing concept) I created a few months back. However, I've felt like it's becoming a chore to continue. </p><p><br></p><div class="media-asset-container"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/290/496/large/1.jpg?1538076163" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="290496" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/290/496/medium/1.jpg?1538076163" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><p>For this project, I've been following Alex Senechals "Advanced Tiling Trim" tutorials, to see how I would but his workflow into practice in my own sci fi scene. To briefly describe the workflow, you take a normal map trim sheet, and unwrap your meshes onto that in your first UV layout, then you create a second for a tiling texture to sit on top.  </p><p><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/290/502/large/3.jpg?1538076385" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="290502" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/290/502/medium/3.jpg?1538076385" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><p>The workflow helps to cut down on texturing time massively. It allows you to cut down on the amount of textures, and give you more time to create nice shapes with your modelling tools. I've had some lovely results with the workflow so far, and I've had a blast messing around with cool sci-fi shapes.</p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><br></div><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/290/505/large/4.jpg?1538076624" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="290505" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/290/505/medium/4.jpg?1538076624" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><p>I usually struggle to just drop projects, or leave them unfinished, but it's not been easy to keep going working on this one. With uni starting again, I have less and less free time, and coming home to work on this just isn't keeping me interested. I've been getting really inspired by the works of Pablo Carpio, so I plan on starting something fresh based on one of his beautiful concepts. I'll put a pin in the project and hopefully return to it around christmas or next year, to try finish it off for the portfolio. For now, it can rest. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><div class="media-asset-container media-image fr-draggable fr-fil"><a href="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/290/507/large/2.jpg?1538076948" target="_blank" class="media-asset-image-link"><img data-asset-id="290507" src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/media_assets/images/images/000/290/507/medium/2.jpg?1538076948" class="img-responsive" /></a></div><p><br></p><p>*any comments or critique about the current state of the project are very welcome :)</p>]]>

      <title>The Final Stop by Jonjo Hemmens</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Wrote a blog post for the Rookies on this piece - <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.therookies.co/2019/02/23/creating-compelling-3d-game-environments/">https://blog.therookies.co/2019/02/23/creating-compelling-3d-game-environments/</a></p>

<p>The Final Stop is set in a Russian Subway station that has been closed down for 3 years in favour of using faster, more efficient lines. Since then, vandals have roamed the station, tagging walls and vandalising property. A few weeks ago, a body was found dead with his stomach impaled.</p>

<p>I started this project whilst studying on the Artstation Masterclass, and it took me roughly a month to complete. The project was my own design, and pushed me to develop my blockout skills, and has pushed me to use more substance designer. The scene is using mostly static lighting, with the exception of a few movable / dynamic lights for volumetric fog. Big thanks to Brian Recktenwald, Jonathan Caro, Phillip Meredith, and anyone else who gave me good feedback during the class! </p>]]>
