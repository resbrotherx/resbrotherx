Using emissive materials and having them contribute to the GI in your light bakes is a great way to add soft light sources with no additional rendering cost. This is great for mobile and VR where you have a limited amount of realtime lights on screen, or just adding extra punch to your scifi or cyberpunk scenes.</p><p><br></p><p>The emissive materials bake to the volumetric lightmap as well, so characters and dynamic objects are impacted and match the direction of the glowy bits :) it also has an impact on your volumetric fog, so any night time city scenes will definitely benefit!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Topics covered in the tutorial:</strong></p><p>-setting up an emissive master material</p><p>-using meshes to light your scene</p><p>-how to control how much light is emitted from the mesh/material</p><p>-post process settings for good looking bloom</p><p><br></p><p>I also put the unreal project file up for download on my gumroad, I wanted to give it away for free but gumroad has a 0.99 minimum for files over 25mb. you can find that here: <a href="https://gumroad.com/polygonacademy">https://gumroad.com/polygonacademy</a> </p><p><br></p><p>thanks for watching, I hope it's useful to you :D</p>]]>

<br />This quick blockout/lighting study was made for a tutorial to demonstrate how you can use emissive materials to influence your lighting in UE4. They bake to the lightmaps and volumetric lightmaps so moveable meshes benefit as well. This entire scene is lit by the emissive and 1 small spotlight at the end of the hall. </p>]]>

<br />Took a stab at getting some semi-overcast, Last of Us inspired lighting in this ReLight of Ronald Houtermans' unreal marketplace scene. Lots of cool abandoned places photography helped inspire the look of this scene as well. Baked lighting with a stationary directional and skylight using a basic HDRI, + some hand placed spotlights to add some extra bounce + reflections or fake soft sunlight hits on areas of focus. direct lighting component costs 1.4ms. Added some decals and swapped some materials to get the final look.</p>

      <title>Hong Kong Alley Lighting - UE4 by Tim Simpson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I took a couple evenings to re-light this awesome UE4 Marketplace scene by Tom Meltzer. Added Wiktor Ohman's rain in there for extra mood. Was going for a bit of a Liam Wong X John Wick vibe, with the saturated color palette and heavy reflections. I used  a low lightmap density of about 8-16px/m on most surfaces to keep it within actual gamedev specs and keep bake times under 30 mins. Lighting in takes up about 2ms, so nothing crazy.</p>

<p>My time exploring south east asia came in handy here, as I used my memories of getting caught in sudden intense rainstorms and the humidity of the city as inspiration, as well as the crazy effects of all the neons and fluorescent lights have on alleyways at night.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I spent an evening re-lighting a small section of the awesome Infiltrator demo scene by Epic Games. Did a quick animated lighting pass to add some life. Inspired by Destiny 2/The Divisions lighting style of intense spotlights and flares in the players view.  realtime scene in unreal engine.</p>

<p>One shadow casting spotlight as the key light, the 4 pot lights that turn on are simply moveable lights with no shadow casting and small radius and the rest is all static lights baked for the GI. The goal was to keep it simple but effective.</p>]]>

There is a TON of value here for both students and people in the industry, as I do a bit of a deep dive on developing a career path and the process I use to learn new software and skills. This can apply to self taught artists like me as well as anyone currently in art school or looking to break into the industry. We also talk a bit about the future of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PolygonAcademy"><strong>Polygon Academy</strong></a>, and where I would like to take that project.</p><p><br></p><p> I also go over some  common art test mistakes I see people making consistently such as being afraid to ask questions and get clarification on technical limitations that might be vague in the test outline. It can be an intimidating experience and hopefully this can help put some wind in your sails to CRUSH your next art test and get your art flex on :)</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I then spend a good chunk of time sharing my thoughts on crunch and company culture in a mini "rant" where I give a pretty honest opinion and thoughts on the matter, as it has been in the headlines a lot recently. It is an extremely complex issue and I hope I can shed some personal experience on it for anyone currently struggling through crunch. really hope this helps some of you out!</p><p><br></p><p>As always I really appreciate any feedback in the comments below, let me know what you liked, hated, want more clarification on etc. Thanks for listening!</p><p>-Tim</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<div class="media-asset-container media-asset fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable"><iframe data-asset-id="410096" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IziIY674NAw?feature=oembed&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Hey everyone!</p><p>Just pumped this out last night, a little something for any environment or prop junkies out there to enjoy over the weekend ;)</p><p> Using trim textures to quickly create efficient modular kits is absolutely <strong>the backbone of most environment work</strong>, and even a lot of prop/asset creation, especially when dealing with tight memory budgets, like in the case of open world games.</p><h2><strong>Why you are not getting environment jobs....</strong></h2><p>I still consistently see over HALF of students/junior artists who apply for environment positions with ZERO examples of tiling texture use or trim sheet knowledge in their portfolio. This is a huge red flag and I wanted to create this tutorial on the technique to help fill the gaps left by many game design programs. <strong>If I see a strong use of trim textures in at least one portfolio piece I would feel a lot more confident that the applicant is creative and versatile when it comes to problem solving for environment art, and won't require a ton of re-training.</strong></p><h2><strong>An Essential Skill.....</strong></h2><p>Make no mistake, if you are building environments in a game studio environment you will definitely  have to build large structural kits or assets  at some point. <strong>Trim sheets can be an absolute life saver when it comes to keeping your memory budget and drawcalls down</strong>, and maintaining a crisp texel density without relying on massive 4k  unique unwrap textures......which are still not super feasible for gamedev on consoles. </p><p><br></p><p>Links: </p><p>If you are unfamiliar with using trim textures I added the example assets, unreal project and textures to my gumroad for about 5 bucks. You can load the meshes into the software of your choice and dissect how the UVs are laid out, play around with the trim sheets on your own assets etc. All proceeds will go to building an actual up to date PC to make more tutorials for you guys without my rig bursting into flames :P</p><h3><a href="https://gumroad.com/polygonacademy" target="_blank"><strong>Example trim sheets and meshes on gumroad</strong></a></h3><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading, let me know what you think in the comments!</p><p>-Tim</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<div class="media-asset-container media-asset fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable"><iframe data-asset-id="408191" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibAviIFhAls?feature=oembed&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><br></p><p>I recently had the pleasure of sitting down to have an in depth chat with Gordon Neil on the Digital Artcast Podcast. We covered a ton of topics but I felt there were some really good take-aways for students as well as artists already in the industry on this one! It was my first experience being on a podcast so big thanks to Gordon for making it super easy.</p><p><br></p><p>A quick overview of some key talking points...</p><p><br></p><p>We go over the importance of building a presence on social media as an artist, how you can build an audience and leverage that for opportunities both in terms of jobs or building a profitable side hustle or even a full time income. Hands down I think this is one of the most important things both students and pros in the industry need to be doing, it can really save your ass in the event of mass layoffs or make breaking into the industry a lot easier due to your work just showing up everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>I also go into some detail about how to grow your ArtStation following, how I view the platform and how you can experiment with the various features to get more people to see your work, which of course could lead to more job offers.  By going deep and getting involved in the community across different forums or platforms you can quickly establish yourself as an expert in your field. Anyone looking to grow their following will probably find a couple tips in there.</p><p><br></p><p>We cover how I got into the industry as well as some of the differences between a student/junior and a more senior artist. I found when I was first starting out I was really resistant to feedback and critiques, often to my own detriment. Coming up with excuses or flat out ignoring feedback and moving forward without fixing fundamental problems with my art really held me back. Once I started applying feedback from more experienced artists, my skill level blew up a lot faster. </p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I talk about the importance of being consistent and taking the long view on skill development. Building strong work habits and consistently outputting new work is one of the hallmarks of a professional artist. Having clearly defined goals can really help with this, and then breaking those goals down into a step by step process can really help you get to where you want to go in terms of career and skill development. </p><p>On the flip side of that there is work life balance, which we touch upon as well.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a ton more little topics we cover that should be interesting to both students and pros in the industry so feel free to take a listen and then let me know in the comments below what stood out for you in there!</p><p><br></p>]]>

      <title>How I got my first studio job... by Tim Simpson</title>

        <![CDATA[<div class="media-asset-container media-asset fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable"><iframe data-asset-id="407757" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/apoVKOKzRwA?feature=oembed&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><br></p><p>Hey everyone :)</p><p>So a few times a week I get emails or DM's from people asking me how I got into the industry all those years back. They might be in school or self taught like me and looking for some advice or guidance, or even a little motivation. So hopefully this video gives anyone currently struggling to work on their portfolio or learn some new skills a boost of inspiration and motivation.</p><p><br></p><p>As a self taught artist, the struggle was always uphill, you are entirely accountable to yourself and have to rely on developing self discipline and consistency if you want to get to the skill level required of artists working in the digital art industry these days. There are 3 main key takeaways from the video above, and I can't stress them enough!</p><p><br></p><p>1. Sacrifice: you are probably going to have to sacrifice time from doing leisure activities and take those extra hours and apply them to developing your art skills. Less Netflix, 5 hour gaming sessions or going out and getting shit hammered on Friday nights haha. Short term pain for long term gain! Don't let someone else get that dream job of yours because you were too busy binge watching multiple shows on a weekend or sinking hours into games, are your actions moving the ball towards the goalpost of your intended career path? </p><p><br></p><p>2, Post your work everywhere, you never know who will see it! develop a strong online presence all over the web. ArtStation, Instagram, post your work in progress on sites like polycount for feedback. I got my first job because someone randomly came across my WIP thread of a blown up jersey barrier (cliche AF I know). </p><p><br></p><p>3. PATIENCE!: seriously I can't stress this one enough, I keep getting emails and messages from people saying that they think they suck or are struggling, but they have only been doing art for under a year! Commit to a long term goal and develop some perspective that this is a grind, you are in it for the long game. Try to learn to enjoy the process of creating art, not just the end result.</p><p><br></p><p>Hope this was insightful/inspiring to some of you, I know how frustrating the grind to your first professionally paid gig can be, just keep at it, and keep kicking ass!  I would love to know some of the frustrations anyone going through the process of trying to get their first industry job, drop a comment below :) </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<div class="media-asset-container media-asset fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable"><iframe data-asset-id="407161" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_bqpw5sOwr4?feature=oembed&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><strong>Free Gumroad download link: <a href="https://gum.co/ue4light" target="_blank">https://gum.co/ue4light</a>  </strong></p><p>Hey Everyone,</p><p>When I was first getting into creating environments for game, one of my biggest sticking points was creating decent lighting that made the models and textures I spent hours creating actually look good. <strong>You can have the cleanest model in the world, or the most detailed texture, but if the overall lighting sucks.....your final presentation is really going to suffer. </strong></p><p>I designed these basic presets to give anyone working in unreal a quick head start in having some great looking lighting for any day, night or sunset scenario. This should really help beginner artists or level designers who are not super experienced with lighting in unreal create nice final images. They are also designed for people to dissect and modify to learn what the various settings in a sunlight/skylight lighting setup do. </p><p>In the above tutorial I also go over some of the settings for light baking in lightmass that should help a lot of you get some nicer results, and avoid a lot of the common problems like lightmap seams, splotchy weird bake errors etc. </p><p><br></p><p>Shoutout to Epic Games, who's example content scenes I used to develop these lighting presets, because of how nicely balanced their textures and materials are it made creating PBR compliant lighting super easy. If you are having issues lighting your scenes for different times of day or are finding you have to really crank your intensity values, it would be good to take a look at your albedo values. The paragon and Zen example scenes make for great reference with their albedo values on their textures. <strong>You can find both those example scenes on the unreal marketplace or under the learn tab of the unreal engine launcher.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If you grab the presets, let me know what you plan on using them for in the comments below, I would be super interested to see all your results :)</p>]]>

After stepping away for a while it gives you a bit of a fresh perspective. In this episode of the Polygon Academy tutorial series I go over what I think went right, what went wrong and things I would maybe do differently as well as what I learned over the course of the project. It was such a fun experience both working on the challenge and creating this tutorial series for all you passionate art gangsters! If you havent seen the entire series, you can catch up on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/c/polygonacademy" target="_blank">Polygon Academy Youtube channel</a>!  if you are not yet subscribed, you are breaking my heart ;) </p><p>Did you watch/enjoy the series? let me know below in the comments! I love interacting with you guys. More content to come....</p><p><br></p><p>You guys can also go get that awesome z-up/moss/master material I used all over the scene, my buddy who made it gave me a discount code 25% off for the first 50 people who want to take advantage of it just use <strong>Polygon</strong> at checkout! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgum.co%2FTAiBJ&amp;redir_token=p2Yu16fVqdAQDFgi26hCbS5Xcl98MTU1MjI1MjA5OEAxNTUyMTY1Njk4&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=X0K6He8fPbk">https://gum.co/TAiBJ</a> </p>]]>

      <title>Lighting Paintovers by Tim Simpson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This was an old lighting art test I did that got me a job at Capcom Vancouver (RIP) a few years back. It was a task to see how I could plan out lighting and add mood to a scene by doing a quick paintover. Each one took about an hour in photoshop. </p>

<p>Doing quick lighting paintovers can save so much time during production, as you can quickly iterate in 2D and know what you are going for before spending more time in 3D. Saves a ton of time and experimenting with long lighting bakes. I attached a mini breakdown with notes and the original images provided by capcom, which were from Dead Rising 2.</p>]]>

SpaceMarine was one of my favorite projects I have worked on, the over the top destruction and violence made building the rubble filled environments extremely fun. I was responsible for 3 levels at the start of the game and 2 towards the end of the campaign. I got a chance to get my hands dirty on almost every aspect of the world building process, lighting, texturing, level art etc.</p>

<p>I hope the game gets a sequel one day, it's an underrated gem <img class="emoji" alt="smiley" src="https://cdn.artstation.com/mailer/emoji/smiley.png" /> </p>]]>

      <title>Into The DataCore by Tim Simpson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This scene was originally supposed to be a quick weekend long project mainly as a lighting study. As usual, the scope expanded a bit and I decided to flesh it out a bit further. Inspired by Beeple, Destiny 2 &amp; Star Wars.</p>

<p>Created using the popular medium poly + decals workflow with some basic tiling materials, and the rest was done with a single texture/trim sheet for pretty much everything. If you look closely you can see the same repeated details everywhere, from the computer to the pipes and wall panels. It helped keep the production quick while letting me focus on the lighting and letting implied detail do most of the work.</p>

<p>The awesome steam particles were lifted directly from Wiktor Ohman's awesome scifi environment and also just used some of the basic BP-Fogsheets from the infiltrator demo to help add some atmosphere. If you like it, smash that follow button, I have more content coming soon <img class="emoji" alt="smiley" src="https://cdn.artstation.com/mailer/emoji/smiley.png" /> and I would love to hear your thoughts, critiques &amp; questions in the comments! </p>]]>
